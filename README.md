# Neptune DXP Open Edition documentation
The documentation for the Neptune DXP Open Edition is hosted here on Neptune GitHub. We use separate branches for authoring and publishing the documentation.

## Git workflow

The workflow is explained in detail in OneNote [here](https://parson01.sharepoint.com/sites/NeptuneDocumentationSupport/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FNeptuneDocumentationSupport%2FFreigegebene%20Dokumente%2FGeneral%2FNotes%20for%20Neptune
onenote:https://parson01.sharepoint.com/sites/NeptuneDocumentationSupport/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/General/Notes%20for%20Neptune/).

The following gives a short overview:

### Authoring 
Create a new temporary feature branch from **main** when starting to work on the documentation. Give the branch a speaking name, for example, "tile-configuration". 

### Reviewing
* When the author is finished writing, he creates a pull request in GitHub.
* In the pull request, he assigns one or more reviewer.
* When the review is done, the feature branch is merged back in the "main".
* After the merge the temporary branch can be deleted.

### Publishing
* The *main** branch contains the final documentation to be published.
* Publishing to https://docs.neptune-software.com, where the documentation that is published on the Neptune website is located, is done via a separate GitHub repository: https://github.com/neptune-software/dxp-documentation.
* Antora pulls the content directly from the Git branches, see [Repositories and Content Source Roots](https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/content-source-repositories/).
* Each push to the **main** branch triggers the GitHub Action Workflow [Publish](https://github.com/neptune-software/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml).
* All content from the `app_location` folder is uploaded to the [static Azure site](https://docs-poc.neptune-software.com).
* The publish workflow can also be triggered manually.

#### Configuration files for deploy process
* _.github/workflows/[publish.yml](https://github.com/neptune-software/documentation/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml)_: Settings for publishing as Azure Static Web App
* _[build.sh](https://github.com/neptune-software/documentation/blob/master/build.sh)_: Optional build steps

#### Antora-related files
* _antora/neptune-ui/ui-bundle.zip_: Customized UI bundle
* [_antora/neptune-docs-playbook_neptune.yml](https://github.com/neptune-software/documentation/blob/main/antora/neptune-docs-playbook.yml)_: Antora playbook file

#### Hosting
* The static site is hosted using [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/).
* URL: [docs-poc.neptune-software.com](https://docs-poc.neptune-software.com).

#### Additional information
* For all configuration options see [Specific settings for Azure Static Web App](https://aka.ms/swaworkflowconfig).
* The `app_location` folder is defined in [publish.yml](https://github.com/neptune-software/documentation/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml). You can skip the building step and  [publish directly from this folder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/github-actions-workflow#skip-building-front-end-app).
* The `app_build_command` key specifies to run `./build.sh` which is an example of a "build step". This step right now creates a folder `tempdir` and copies the example `index.html` from the root folder into it. You are free to modify these, using the build steps/logic you deem necessary.

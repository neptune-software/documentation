= Headings

== Levels
Apart from the topic title (h1), use up to two subheadings (h2, h3) in a topic.

INFO:: The topic title can only be assigned once.

If you need more heading levels, highlight a term in bold, followed by a colon or a full stop and write the heading starting with a capital letter.

Example::

*Heading 4*. Highlight a term in bold.

Avoid hyphens headings if you can.
In resized windows or mobile devices, they can result in awkward line breaks.

Donâ€™t use ampersands (&) or plus signs (+) headings unless you're referring to the UI that contains them.

== Capitalization
Use sentence style for all headings except for proper nouns.

Examples::
* Install App Designer
* Design an application from scratch
* Getting started with Tile Blackout

= Active vs passive voice

== Prefer active to passive voice
Active voice is clearer and shorter and emphasizes the role of the actor instead of the action.
An actor can be a user or even software.
Because we write from a user's perspective, the active voice is more friendly.
If the actor is unknown or irrelevant, you can use passive voice.

Examples::
* *Yes*: The data access subsystem uses this interface to control data providers.
* *No*: This interface is used by the data access subsystem to control data providers.

== Avoid impersonal formulation
Avoid „is/are to be + participle“ to express a task.
This structure is  complicated and does not address the reader directly.
A direct instruction facilitates the quick and easy execution of a task.

Examples::
* *Yes*: Install the software after the download.
* *No*: The software is to be installed after the download.
* *Yes*: Execute the command.
* *No*: The command is to be executed.

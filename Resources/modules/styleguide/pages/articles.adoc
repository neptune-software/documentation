= Articles

Articles show grammatical relationships.
Articles can make sentences more comprehensible and cause fewer problems during the translation process.

* Use an article before a noun.

Example::
Press the red button to turn off the machine.

* Use an article when referring to a service on the Cockpit of Neptune DXP platform, which is written as a proper noun.

Example::
The _App Designer_ is part of Neptune DXP - Open Edition.

** Exception: Do not use an article if it does not make sense in terms of language. This could be the case when the name of the service contains a verb.
+
Example::
With _Deployment Transfer_, you can approve and send artifacts to other systems.

* Do not use an article for names or when referring to Neptune DXP software.

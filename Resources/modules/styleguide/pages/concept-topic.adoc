= About concept topics

Provide conceptual information, for example, about the architecture of a software.

Requires no standard structure.

== Best practices

* Keep the topic short.
* Structure the topic well with headlines and sub-headlines.
* Make sure that the topic is self-contained and can stand on its own.
* Reintroduce abbreviations.
* Link to related topics (task, concept, reference).
* If the topics become too long and split it up into several independent topics.
Make sure that  split-up topics are still self-contained.

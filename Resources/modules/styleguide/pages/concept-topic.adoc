= About concept topics

* Provide conceptual information, for example, about the architecture of a software.

* Concept topics require no standard structure.

== Best practices

* Keep the topic short.
* Structure the topic well with headlines and sub-headlines.
* Make sure that the topic is self-contained and can stand on its own.
* Reintroduce abbreviations that are mentioned in another topic.
* Link to related topics (task, concept, reference).
* If the topics become too long, split it up into several independent topics.
Make sure that the split-up topics are still self-contained.
* Use the Neptune icon library to insert icons of the service in the title.
* Never use bold or italics in the title, even if you refer to another service.
* Focus on the essentials and create separate topics for more specific explanations, if necessary.
* Do not integrate tasks

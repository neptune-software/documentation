= Special notices

We use three types of special notices:

TIP: Provides a helpful tip, for example: Watch the video "How to create a resource group".

NOTE: Provides additional information on a subject.

IMPORTANT: Warns readers about possible damage to equipment or data, about potential problems in the outcome of what they are doing, or potential negative experiences.

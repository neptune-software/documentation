= Topic-based writing

== What is a topic-based writing approach?
* Structures all content around topics that can be mixed and reused in different contexts.
* Does not follow a linear structure as in books.
* Is perfectly suited for online documentation. User can jump to a topic from every point in the documentation.

== What is a topic?
* Unique piece of content with a specific purpose (task, concept or reference).
* Self-contained.
* Deals with one subject.
* Does not require external content to understand.
* Is as short as possible and as required.
* Is suited for the target group and implies that the reader has the required knowledge to understand the subject.
* Answers the questions of the reader.
* Links to related topics.

== Topic types
Topics are always of a particular type. Topics can be instructive or provide conceptual or reference information.
For Neptune, we use the following topic types:

* Task, see general information in xref:task-topic.adoc[] and an example in xref:task-topic-example.adoc[].
* Concept, see general information in xref:concept-topic.adoc[] and an example in xref:concept-topic-example.adoc[].
* Reference, see general information in xref:reference-topic.adoc[] and an example in xref:reference-topic-example.adoc[].

Readers should immediately recognize the topic type by its title and structure.

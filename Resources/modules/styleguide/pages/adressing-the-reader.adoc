= Adressing the reader

Even though your document may affect thousands of people, you are speaking to the one person who is reading it.
When your writing reflects this, it is more economical and has a greater impact.

== Use pronouns to speak directly to your reader
Pronouns help the audience picture themselves in the text and relate to what you are saying.
More than any other single technique, using “you” pulls users into the information and makes it relevant to them.

When you use “you” to address users, they are more likely to understand what their responsibility is.

=== Example
* *Yes*: Update the software before using the new features.
* *No*: The software must be updated before using the new features.

== Avoid using “he” or “she”
You can avoid awkwardness by using “you” to address the reader directly, rather than using “he or she” or “his or her.”

=== Example
* *Yes*: You must provide your mailing address and identification number.
* *No*:The applicant must provide his or her mailing address and his or her identification number.

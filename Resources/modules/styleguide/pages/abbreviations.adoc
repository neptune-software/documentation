= Abbreviations

* Only use abbreviations that are well established, for example, AWS for Amazon Web Services.
* Do not create your own abbreviations.
* When you first introduce an abbreviation, use the spelled-out form, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
** Continue with the abbreviation in the topic.
** For each new topic, repeat introducing the abbreviation in this manner when it first occurs as a topic should be self-contained.

== Example
* We use Amazon Web Services (AWS).

If you want to use AWS, make sure you have all the required information.

== Latin abbreviations
Do not use the following Latin abbreviations:

* e.g. (for example)
* i.e. (that is)

Instead, use the long form and split it with commas:

Examples::
** Only use software that you trust, for example, Neptune DXP.
** Only use a software service that guarantees data security, that is, protects your personal data and offers a VPN client.

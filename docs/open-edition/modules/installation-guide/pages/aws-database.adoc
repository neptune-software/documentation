[TIP]
====
At the beginning of the *Create database* dialog, you can choose to do a standard or easy creation. Easy creation uses best-practice configurations and reduces manual configuration to a minimum. You can use the easy creation and check on the configurations at the bottom of the dialog.
[WARNING]
Easy creation does not show the *Estimated monthly costs*.

//Helle@parson: 1. there was no easy creation when original documentation was written. 2. Hopefully, tip and warning look better in published documentation, feedback welcome...
//Fabian: A "Warning" inside a "Tip" looks a bit odd. Write the "Warning" below the "Tip".
. In *Engine options*, select *PostgreSQL*.
//Helle@Neptune: The PostgreSQL version is automatically set to 13.3-R1. Is this correct?
//Fabian: The following is no step for its own but an introduction to the following steps. Maybe work with substeps for that?
. Set the following configurations according to your needs.
. Click *Create database*.
+
*Result*: Your database details have been sent to AWS. AWS need to launch your database. This can take 10-15 minutes.
. To watch the current status of your database, open the *Services* menu.
. Go to the *Database* section and click *RDS*.
. Under *Resources*, click *DB Instances*.
. To see the details of your database, click on the *DB identifier* of your database.
//Fabian: Maybe have a screenshot for the previous steps?
NOTE: Do not close this tab. You need this information in the next steps.

== Result

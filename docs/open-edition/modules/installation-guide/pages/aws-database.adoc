[TIP]
====
At the beginning of the *Create database* dialog, you can choose to do a standard or easy creation. Easy creation uses best-practice configurations and reduces manual configuration to a minimum. You can use the easy creation and check on the configurations at the bottom of the dialog.
[WARNING]
Easy creation does not show the *Estimated monthly costs*.

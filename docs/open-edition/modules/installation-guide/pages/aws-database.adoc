[WARNING]
====
At the beginning of the *Create database* dialog, you can choose to do a standard or easy creation. Easy creation uses best-practice configurations and reduces manual configuration to a minimum. You can use the easy creation and check on the configurations at the bottom of the dialog.

Easy creation does not show the *Estimated monthly costs*.

. In *Engine options*, select *PostgreSQL*.
//TODO: Helle@Neptune: The PostgreSQL version is automatically set to 13.3-R1. Is this correct?

. Set the following configurations according to your needs:
.. Click *Create database*.
+
*Result*: Your database details have been sent to AWS. AWS need to launch your database. This can take 10-15 minutes.

.. To watch the current status of your database, open the *Services* menu.
.. Go to the *Database* section and click *RDS*.
.. Under *Resources*, click *DB Instances*.
.. To see the details of your database, click on the *DB identifier* of your database.

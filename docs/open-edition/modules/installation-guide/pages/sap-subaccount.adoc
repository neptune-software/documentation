= Set up a subaccount on the SAP Cloud Platform

After you created the trial account, you set up a subaccount on the SAP Cloud Platform.

A subaccount adds another level to your trial account. You can have different subaccounts for different purposes. In this case, you set up a subaccount to host Neptune DXP - Open Edition and your applications.

== Prerequisites
* You have created a trial account on the SAP Cloud Platform.

*Result:* All subaccounts are displayed with their entitlements. Your subaccount has no entitlements. The trial subaccount has many entitlements.

//Result?
NOTE: Your SAP account has four memory units by default. All four units are assigned to the trial subaccount created by SAP. You must transfer the memory units to the subaccount that you created for Neptune DXP - Open Edition so that your subaccount can use the memory.

=== Transfer memory units to the trial subaccount

. Click *Configure Entitlements* to start the trial subaccount.
. In the *Cloud Foundry Runtime* row, click the trash bin icon to free up all four memory units.
. Click *Save*.

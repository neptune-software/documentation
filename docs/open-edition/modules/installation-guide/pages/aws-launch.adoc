= Launch the AWS instance

In this topic, you create and launch an instance in the AWS console.
An instance is a virtual server in the AWS cloud that you can connect to the DXP - Open Edition.

== Prerequisites

* You have an account at the AWS platform.
* You created a key pair in the AWS console.

== Procedure

. On the side menu of your AWS console, navigate to the *Instances* section and click *Instances*.
//Helle@parson: Instances is a heading in Instances section, not the same. Clicking the section does nothing but expanding and collapsing the section. Instances is the first heading, so even if user click the section, finding the heading is easy.
. On the *Instances* panel, click *Launch Instances*.

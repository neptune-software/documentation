//Helle: needs to be updated for new cockpit.

. Go to the *Database* tab.
. From the *Type* drop-down menu, select *PostgreSQL (9.6 or later)*.
. If you want to establish a secure SSL connection with the database server, check the *Use SSL* box.
//Helle: What happens if I do, what if I don't?
.. If you checked the *Use SSL* box, enter the URI in the *URI* field.
//Helle: what URI? Where do I get it?
.. If you did not check the *Use SSL* box, enter either the URI in the *URI* field or the hostname in the *Host* field.
//Helle: where do I get the hostname?
//Helle: please check if this workflow is correct. Do I only add the Host, if I did not check SSL box?

= Create a database schema with SQL client

You need a database to work with your virtual machine.
This topic explains how you create a database schema with SQL client.

== Prerequisites

* xref:azure-create-database.adoc[You have completed the Postgres database setup].
* xref:azure-firewall.adoc[You have configured your firewall].
* You have Docker installed. You can get it https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[here].

== Procedure

. Open your Postgres database.
. Click *Connection Security* > *Add client IP*. Add your public IP address here.
+
NOTE: Disable *Enforce SSL connection* in case your SQL client does not support this.
+
. Start an SQL client. The following steps base on https://www.adminer.org/[Adminer] but other SQL clients work similarly.
.. Open a console and type:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
docker run -p 9000:8080 adminer
----
to start Docker and the Adminer client.
.. Type in your browser:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
localhost:9000
----
Press *Enter*.
.. Click *System* > *PostgreSQL*.
... Enter a *server name*. This must be the server name specified in the Azure portal.
... Enter an *admin username*. This must be the one specified in the Azure portal.
... Enter a password. This must be the password you used when creating the database.
+
NOTE: You do not need to specify a database.
.. Click *Login*.
.. Select the target database.
.. Run the following SQL script against that target database:
//TODO: Is that still up to date?
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
create schema planet9
----
+
.. Stop the Docker image.
. Click *Connection Security* > *Enforce SSL connection*.

== Result

You have created a database schema with SQL client.

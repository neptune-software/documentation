= Add a new quota plan

In this topic, you learn how to add a new quota plan for additional Space in your SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).
In the quota plan, you allow the Space to use a specific amount of memory.

== Prerequisites
* You have created a trial account on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) in xref:sap-trial-account.adoc[].
* You have created a subaccount on the SAP BTP with four memory units assigned in xref:sap-subaccount.adoc[].
* You have enabled Cloud Foundry in xref:sap-cloud-foundry.adoc[].
* You have added organizational Space to your subaccount in xref:sap-space.adoc[].

== Procedure
. In the menu, open the *Cloud Foundry* submenu.
. Click *Quota Plans* > *New Plan*.
.. Enter `memQ` as *Name*.

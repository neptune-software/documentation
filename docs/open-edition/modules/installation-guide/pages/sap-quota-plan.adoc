= Add a new quota plan to the organizational Space of your SAP Cloud subaccount

After you have added organizational Space to your SAP Cloud Platform, you create a new quota plan for that Space. This is where you allow the Space to use a specific amount of memory.

== Prerequisites
* You have created a trial account on SAP Cloud Platform.
* You have created a subaccount on SAP Cloud Platform with four memory units assigned.
* You enabled Cloud Foundry.
* You added organizational Space to your subaccount.

== Procedure
. On the menu, open the *Cloud Foundry* submenu.
. Click *Quota Plans* and then *New Plan*.
. In  *Name*, enter "memQ".
. In  *Memory (MB)*, enter "4096". This equals 4 GB and allows your Space to use all four memory units.

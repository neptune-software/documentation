= Add a new quota plan to the organizational Space of your SAP Cloud subaccount

After you have added organizational Space to your SAP Cloud Platform, you create a new quota plan for that Space. This is where you allow the Space to use a specific amount of memory.

== Prerequisites
* You have created a trial account on SAP Cloud Platform.
* You have created a subaccount on SAP Cloud Platform with four memory units assigned.
* You have enabled Cloud Foundry.
* You have added organizational Space to your subaccount.

== Procedure
. In the menu, open the *Cloud Foundry* submenu.
. Click *Quota Plans* > *New Plan*.
.. Enter `memQ` as *Name*.
.. Enter `4096` in *Memory (MB)*. This equals 4 GB and allows your Space to use all four memory units.
//Helle@Neptune: The explanation above is an assumption. Please check.

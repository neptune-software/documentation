= Create a key pair for an instance on the AWS console

//Fabian: How do we call sections? "Topic" (like here), "Section", "Chapter"? Do we have a rule for that? If not, we need one.
In this topic, you create a key pair to launch an instance on the AWS console in later steps.

== Prerequisites

* You have an account at the AWS platform.

== Procedure

. Type the following URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com.
. Login to the AWS Console.
. On the top menu, open *Services*.
. Go to the *Compute* section and click *EC2*. A new window opens.

. Click *Create key pair* to generate keys for the instance.

+
. Enter a name for the key pair.
. Make sure that *RSA* is selected as the key pair type and *.ppk* as the private key file format.
//Helle@parson: both preselected by default.
//Fabian: Insert a screenshot here?
. Click *Create key pair*.

//Fabian: Insert Oxford comma.
*Result*: The newly created key pair appears in the key pairs overview with the name, type, fingerprint and ID.

// Fabian: I think we should call the following section "Results" as it sums up the results from the procedure-section. Otherwise, the reader could be a bit lost if there are more than one "result" sections.
== Result
You have created a key pair for an AWS instance.

Subscription:: Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for your server.
Resource group:: Create a new resource group or select an existing one.
Select source:: Select *Blank* to create a new server from scratch.

Version:: Select the latest major PostgreSQL  version, unless you have specific requirements otherwise.
Pricing tier:: Select the compute, storage, and backup configurations for your new server.
Consider using the *basic* pricing tier if light compute and I/O are adequate for your workload.
//Uta: check "compute"
//Fabian: Check in what sense? The phrase is derived from the original manual.
+
NOTE: Servers created in the *basic* pricing tier cannot be scaled to *General Purpose* or *Memory Optimized* later.
//Note Fabian: There is another screenshot here in the crowded documentation but you it is not necessary to have it in my opinion.
+
. Click *Create* to create the server. This may take a few minutes.
+
TIP: Click *Pin to dashboard* to create a tile for this server on your Azure portal dashboard as a shortcut to the server's overview page.

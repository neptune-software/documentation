= Load balancing
:!figure-caption:

Neptune DXP - Open Edition supports load balancing and high availability set up.
This is achieved by having multiple Neptune DXP - Open Edition instances configured with the same database.
These Neptune DXP - Open Edition instances can be located behind a load balancer.
By locating Neptune DXP - Open Edition instances on hosts which are in different availability zones you can achieve high availability.
This is illustrated xref:installation-guide:load-balancing.adoc#bc67aae8-7e0f-422d-87e5-149806029ff8[below].

== Limitations to load balancing

There are currently some limitations to the usage of high availability.
We are actively working on solutions to resolve these limitations in future releases. Based on your individual setup (virtual machines, Kubernetes, ...) other solutions might be suitable.

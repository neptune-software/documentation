= Deploy your application to the SAP Cloud Foundry Space with Docker Image

You have defined all configurations on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). Now you connect the subaccount you created with Neptune DXP - Open Edition.

== Prerequisites
* You have created a trial account on the SAP BTP.
* You have created a subaccount on the SAP BTP with four memory units assigned.
* You have enabled Cloud Foundry.
* You have created a space in your subaccount.
* You have added a quota plan to the space of your subaccount.

== Procedure
. Install the Command Line Interface (CLI) for Cloud Foundry (cf).
+
NOTE: You can find the installation file for macOS, Windows, and Linux here: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads[Downloads].
. Follow the installation guide https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html[here].

[source,asciidoc]
----
cf login -a API Endpoint
----

. Enter your login credentials to the SAP BTP. Check if the `Org name` and `Space name` match with the details of your SAP subaccount.
. Enter the following command and replace `App Name` with the name of your app in Neptune DXP - Open Edition:
//Helle@Neptune: documentation says: "cf push <any app name>  -m 4096M --docker-image ...", does "any app name" refer to an app already built in Open Edition by the user?
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
cf push App Name -m 4096M --docker-image docker.io/neptunesoftware/planet9:latest
----
+
NOTE: While deploying, your command prompt or terminal shows an error message. You can ignore this error and continue following the steps. If your command prompt or terminal stays in a loop, press Ctrl+C to break it.
//TODO: Helle@Neptune: has this been solved?
. On the SAP BTP, click *Cloud Foundry* > *Spaces*. Click on the name of your space. The application overview of your space opens.

//TODO: Helle@Neptune: Do you execute the commands separately?
. Click *Overview* > *Restart* (or *Start*). After a few minutes, the indicator above the *Restart* button switches from `Starting` to `Started`.
. In *Application Routes*, click on the link. You are forwarded to the login page of Neptune DXP - Open Edition.
. Sign in with the *Username* `admin` and the *Password* `admin`.

== Result

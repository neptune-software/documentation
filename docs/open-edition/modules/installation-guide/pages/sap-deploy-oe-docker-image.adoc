. Enter the following command and replace `App Name` with the name of your app in DXP - Open Edition:
//Helle@Neptune: documentation says: "cf push <any app name>  -m 4096M --docker-image ...", does "any app name" refer to an app already built in Open Edition by the user?

[source,asciidoc]
----
cf push App Name -m 4096 --docker-image docker.io/neptunesoftware/planet9:latest

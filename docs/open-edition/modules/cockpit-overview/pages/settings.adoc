= Settings

The _Settings_ service group provides two services that allow you to make or adjust general settings for the entire system.

* In _System Settings_, you configure _DXP - Open Edition_ system properties to operate in your server environment.

NOTE: Settings you make here require a restart of the system.

* In _Custom Settings_  you can further customize the system to fit your requirements.
For example, you can customize the layout of the login screen or the homepage.

NOTE: Settings you make here do not require a restart of the system.

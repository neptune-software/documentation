= Call a rule like an API in a script

You can call a rule like it is an API endpoint. Enter the following code in a script:

`p9.rulesengine.execute(dataObject, ruleID)`

dataObject:: Key-value pair. Example: `stock: stock_level`.
ruleID:: The ID provided to your rule in the *General* tab.

== Example for a rule that is called as an API

. You can setup a with one attribute:
+
image::rules-engine-test-stock.png[,400]
+
. Provide the following conditions:
+
image::rules-engine-test-stock2.png[,400]
+
. Testing the rule returns this, for example:
+
image::rules-engine-test-stock3.png[,200]

This rule is now included in a script that has the purpose to determine if a stock level is okay or low.

* The key-value pair {stock: stock_level} is passed into the rule
* The result is stored in the stock_warning var.
* An `await` is used in the rule to store the result in the variable, when it returns.

//Comment Fabian: I took that example from the existing documentation. Is it understandable to you?

//Information for Hendrik: We took this chapter from the old documentation but it does not belong to the cockpit overview. It describes a complex task using two services. We will probably integrate it in "Design Guidelines" and will therefore edit it later.

= Call a rule like an API in a script

You can call a rule like it is an API endpoint. Enter the following code in a script:

`p9.rulesengine.execute(dataObject, ruleID)`

dataObject:: Key-value pair. Example: `stock: stock_level`.
ruleID:: The ID provided to your rule in the *General* tab.

== Prerequisites
* You have defined a rule with xref:rules-engine.adoc[Rules engine].
* You have defined a server script with the API Designer
//* xref to be added when topic is finished

== Example for a rule that is called as an API

. You can setup a rule with one attribute:
+
image::rules-engine-test-stock.png[,400]
+
. Provide the following conditions:
+
image::rules-engine-test-stock2.png[,400]
+
. Testing the rule returns this, for example:
+
image::rules-engine-test-stock3.png[,200]

This rule can now be included in a script that has the purpose to determine if a stock level is `okay` or `low`.

* The key-value pair {stock: stock_level} is passed into the rule.
* The result is stored in the `stock_warning` var.
* An `await` is used in the rule to store the result in the variable, when it returns.

log.info("Checking stock for: "+productName);

var table = entities.products_3d;
var product = await table. find({
    select: ["stock_level"],
    where: {
        "description": productName,
    },
});
var stock_level = product[0].stock_level;

var stock_warning = await p9.rulesengine.execute({stock: stock_level}, "82396716-2a13-456a-a475-9ccd6b1dff04");

result = {"stock_level":stock_level,"stock_warning":stock_warning};

console.log(result);

//Comment Fabian: I took that example from the existing documentation.

Helle: This is a bit confusing though I get where it's going.
The Title suggests a task ("Call..."), that could actually do the trick:

Title
Prerequ: You defined a rule, you defined a server script? (Server scripts are defined/created in API Designer)

Steps: open server script, add call, see result.

I guess, that needs more input. Delay this topic and write in parallel with Create Server Script with API Designer?

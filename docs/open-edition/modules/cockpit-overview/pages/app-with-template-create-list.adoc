//todo Neptune: Hovering over the icon shows the text "connected" even for empty fields (which are not connected to anything yet, as I understand it). More fitting would be "Bind". This is also reflected in the pop-up window "Binding" when clicking the icon. I suggest renaming the text to "Bind" here.
//Neptune@Parson: Good point. Feature request created

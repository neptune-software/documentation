= The Adaptive Designer interface at a glance

//terminology: UI vs. interface
//list interface elements for xrefs
// side navigation, shell bar, reusable component panel, application component panel, application preview panel, application properties panel (harmonize with App Designer)
//do we need all sections in this topic? I would prefer to keep it "at a glance" and xref to single subtopics
//provide new SUI
//set default page here -> designer
//TODO Leonie: fill topic

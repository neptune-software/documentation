= Add properties to a table definition

In this topic, you learn how to add properties to your database table and make custom settings.

== Prerequisites

* You have xref:table-definition-configure.adoc[configured a table definition].

== Procedure

. In the Cockpit, go to *Tools* and click _Table Definition_.
. Open your database table.
. Navigate to the *Properties* tab.
. Click *+ Add* to add a new column to the table.
. Enter a column name to each column, for example, `name`, `number`, `rank`, and `squad`.
. In *Type*, select a data type for the column.
//todo Helle: write reference topic on data types and add link here.
//Fabian: Do we really need such a reference topic? This is the only time I saw these data types before and most of them are self-explanatory.
//but there are special types. Limits might be interesting in some cases. ;)
//Fabian: that is true, but how do you know what all these types are exactly about? Would require a lot of testing.
. You can enter a *Description* and *Default value*.
. For columns that can only have unique values, activate *Unique*.
. For columns that can have no value, activate *Nullable*.

In _Development Package_, you organize and group artifacts.
These artifacts, for example, API, Apps, or Themes, can be assigned to a package for better handling.

When setting up new artifacts in other services, for example, the _App Designer_, the _Adaptive Designer_, or the _API Designer_, you can often choose to have that artifact become part of a specific package.
Packaging facilitates the handling of multiple artifacts that behave in a similar way.

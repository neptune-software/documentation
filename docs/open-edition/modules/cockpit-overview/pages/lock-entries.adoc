A lock mechanism prevents that components of Neptune DXP - Open Edition  can be changed simultaneously.
Components can be applications, tiles, users, server scripts, or users.

Neptune DXP - Open Edition locks components for the following reasons:

* Whenever a user starts editing a component.
* When components are updated by the system.

When a component is locked, other users can then access it in display mode.

A lock is removed after the user releases the component.

Locks set by the update function are maintained by the system until the transaction (application) change has been processed or terminated prematurely. If a problem is preventing the update, the locks generated by the update records waiting to be processed block the system.

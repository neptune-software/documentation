A lock mechanism prevents that components can be changed simultaneously.
This can happen when different users are working on the same component at the same time, or a system performs an update.
Components are applications, tiles, users, server scripts, or users.

Components are locked for the following reasons:

* A user starts editing a component.
* Components are updated by the system.

When a component is locked, other users can access the component in display mode only.

A lock is removed after the user releases the component.

Locks set by the update function are maintained by the system until the transaction (application) change has been processed or terminated prematurely.
If a problem is preventing the update, the locks that were generated by the update records and are waiting to be processed block the system.

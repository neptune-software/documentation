A lock mechanism prevents that components can be changed simultaneously.
This might happen when different users are working on the same component at the same time or a system update is being performed.
Components are applications, tiles, users, server scripts, or users.

Components are locked for the following reasons:

* Whenever a user starts editing a component.
* When components are updated by the system.

When a component is locked, other users can only access it in display mode.

A lock is removed after the user releases the component.

Locks set by the update function are maintained by the system until the transaction (application) change has been processed or terminated prematurely. If a problem is preventing the update, the locks generated by the update records waiting to be processed block the system.

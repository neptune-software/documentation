= PDF designer settings

In the *PDF Document Settings* tab, you can configure the settings of your PDF template according to your needs. You can enter a name, a description what the Template is about and allocate it to a package.

You can add an interface to your template. An interface is used to insert data into your PDF template when calling it from a server script with an API.

//TODO Fabian: Add example snippet here.

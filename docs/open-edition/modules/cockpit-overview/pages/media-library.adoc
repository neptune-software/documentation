In the _Media Library_, you store all media files you want to integrate into your application or you want to use in other cockpit components.

In the _Media Library_, folders are organized by file type. Media files should only be stored in a folder that corresponds to their own file type to improve searchability.

The following media files are supported in the media library:

* Images
* Audio files
* Videos
* Splash screens
* Icons
* Documents

= Adaptive tile table

The adaptive tile template table provides functionalities to create an adaptive application in _Adaptive Designer_ based on the predefined data sources that runs directly within a tile in a launchpad.

The resulting adaptive application displays real-time data in a list-like display similar to adaptive applications created with the analytic list template. However, you cannot further customize or edit the data set on the tile, except from sorting it.

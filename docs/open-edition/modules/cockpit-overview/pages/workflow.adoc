= Workflow

With _Workflow_, you can manage and monitor processes in your system.
It is designed to facilitate and automate processes that include multiple tasks in different services.

//TODO: Needs more explanations!

You can start a workflow manually from the _Overview_ service or automatically from an app or server script.

In the _App Designer_ object properties, you can edit selected components in the application tree.
The UI object pane shows basic properties, such as name, description or paths to connected resources.
In the properties pane, you define the component in detail. Select from predefined values, enter new values, bind data from resources, or add scripts to events.

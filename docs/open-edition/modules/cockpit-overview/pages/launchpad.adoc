_Launchpad_ is a  browser-based administration tool to create, design, and maintain launchpads.
A launchpad is the homepage for Neptune DXP - Open Edition applications on mobile and desktop devices.

A launchpad displays tiles.
Each tile represents an application that users can launch.

Tiles can display live status indicators, such as a number of open tasks.
Learn more about xref:tiles.adoc[Tiles] and xref:tile-groups.adoc[Tile groups].

A launchpad supports role-based access and displays tiles according to user roles. See also <<User roles and user groups>>.

* Applications are connected to tiles.
* Tiles are bundled in a tile group. A tile should always be connected with a tile group to maintain a parent-child relationship in the launchpad.
* Tile groups can be assigned to other tile group to maintain a multi-level hierarchy.
* Tile groups are added to the launchpad.

=== User roles and user groups

* Users and user groups are assigned a specific role.
* Roles are assigned to a tile or a tile group.
* Each role can access an authorized launchpad, tiles, and tile groups.

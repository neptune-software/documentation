_Launchpad_ is a  browser-based administration tool to create, design, and maintain launchpads.
A launchpad is the homepage for Neptune DXP - Open Edition applications on mobile and desktop devices.

A launchpad displays tiles.
Each tile represents an application that users can launch.

Tiles can display live status indicators, such as a number of open tasks.
//Learn more about xref:tiles.adoc[Tiles] and xref:tile-groups.adoc[Tile groups].

A launchpad supports role-based access and displays  tiles according to user roles. See also <<User roles and user groups>>.

* Applications are connected to *tiles*.
* *Tiles* are bundled in a *tile group* and should always be connected with a *tile group* to maintain a parent-child relationship on the launchpad.
* *Tile groups* can be assigned to other *tile groups* to
maintain multi-level hierarchy.
* *Tile groups* are added to the launchpad.

=== User roles and user groups

* *Users* and *user groups* are assigned a specific *role*.

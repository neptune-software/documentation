_Launchpad_ is a browser-based administration tool to create, design, and maintain launchpads.
A launchpad is the homepage for Neptune DXP - Open Edition applications on mobile and desktop devices.

A launchpad displays tiles.
Each tile represents an application that users can launch.

Tiles can display live status indicators, such as a number of open tasks.
//Learn more about xref:tiles.adoc[Tiles] and xref:tile-groups.adoc[Tile groups].

A launchpad supports role-based access and displays  tiles according to user roles. See also <<User roles and user groups>>.

maintain multi-level hierarchy.
* *Tile groups* are added to the launchpad.

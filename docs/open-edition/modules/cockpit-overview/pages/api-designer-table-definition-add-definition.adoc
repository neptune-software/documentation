= Add a definition and properties

include::ROOT:partial$api-definition-description.adoc[]

In this task, you learn how to add a definition to a table definition API manually.
With many APIs, you can import definitions or derive definitions from sample requests instead. xref:api-designer-definition-import.adoc[Learn more].

== Prerequisites

* You have xref:api-designer-table-definition-configure.adoc[configured a table definition API].
* You have xref:api-designer-table-definition-add-operation.adoc[added an operation to a table definition].

== Procedure

. Navigate to the *Definitions* tab and click *+* to add a definition.

. Enter a *Name*, for example, `clones`, and *Description*.
//. Select a *Type*.
//Helle@Neptune: What does the type do?
//Fabian@Helle: Funny again, I cannot select a "type" at all, has something changed in between?
//Neptune@Helle: I don´t know :D Seems to be removed.
//Helle: It is still active in my Clones table but does not appear in newly created table def APIs. Commented out for now. Reconsider when dealing with legacy content.

. Navigate to the *Properties* tab and click *+ Add*.
+

+
*Result*: The _API Designer_ adds a new line to specify a property.

. For each property, enter a *Name* that indicates what kind of information the property will hold, for example, `name`, `number`, `rank`, and `squad`.
. Select the allowed *Type* for the property.
+
TIP: If you select `Array`, go to the Actions column and click *+* to add sub-properties to the property.
. Enter a *Description*.
. If you want the property to be mandatory, activate the *Required* box.
. Click *Save*.

If you used the example data in this topic, your properties look like this:

= Configure an application with a SplitApp template

The *SplitApp* template is the base for an app with a general Page (Detail Page) and a Master Page.

The Detail Page shows information in its entirety.
The Master Page is a collapsible page that is designed to show key information and help navigate through entries of a data table. You can adapt the Master Page to hold any other information to fit your application.

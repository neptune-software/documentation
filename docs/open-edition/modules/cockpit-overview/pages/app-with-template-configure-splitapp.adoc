= Configure an application with a SplitApp template

The *SplitApp* template is the base for an app with a general Page (Detail Page) and a Master Page.

The Detail Page shows information in its entirety.
The Master Page is a side menu that is designed to show key information and help navigate through entries of a data table.

//@Neptune: assumption, please check.
//Neptune@Parson: Mostly used like that, but can hold anything. Just a usual page.

= Add data records to a database table

Learn how to add data records manually to a database table that you defined before in _Table Definition_.

NOTE: You can import data from your local computer instead of adding it manually.
Follow the steps, *Run* the database table and click *Import* on the toolbar.
//@Neptune: which formats are allowed for imports?

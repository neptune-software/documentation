= Add data records to a database table

Learn how to add data records manually to a database table that you defined before in _Table Definition_.
//In this topic, you learn how...

NOTE: You can import data from your local system instead of adding it manually.
Follow the steps, *Run* the database table and click *Import* on the toolbar.
//@Neptune: which formats are allowed for imports?
//Fabian: Seem to be only json
//Fabian: I would move that note behind the last point in the "procedure" section and add that you can also export the data.

== Prerequisites

* You have xref:table-definition-configure.adoc[configured a table definition].

You can hide all table definitions created by others to find your table definition easier. To do that, change the *Updated By* filter to *Me*.

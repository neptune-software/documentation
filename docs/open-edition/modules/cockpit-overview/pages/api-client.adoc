= image:api-client-icon.png[width=80] API Client

//Helle@parson: icon looked bigger than the others with width 100, compare api-designer and api-trace. any thoughts on that?
//Fabian@Helle: The png of the API client has a size of only 150x150 pixel. Other icons have 1067x1067 pixel. Go to the file browser, right-click the image, go to "Details" to check. I would just create the image again or adapt the size of the original in Snagit, if possible.

With _API Client_, you send API requests to test the response from the REST API.
//Fabian@Helle: Don't forget the article before Cockpit components :-)

Mock data simulates the behaviour of real data in a controlled way.

When you develop a Neptune DXP - Open Edition application with an OData backend, mock data comes in handy.

== Possible use cases for working with OData mock data
* The backend is not up-to-date. Instead of updating the data in the backend, you can work with mock data that is up-to-date.
* You want to present an application to a customer using mock data to display the customer's product or brand name.
* You want to test your application with certain data, for example, very long names or big numbers.

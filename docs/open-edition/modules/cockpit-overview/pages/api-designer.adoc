With the __API Designer__ you create and configure API definitions.
You can easily define and update APIs at any stage of designing.

The __API Designer__ makes APIs reusable for many applications by just adding that API to the application attributes.

The _API Designer_ provides a set of different functionalities all around the creation and configuration of APIs.
You can create new APIs, update existing APIs, or import and export APIs from an external source.

== API types
The _API Designer_ shows all available types of APIs. There are three types of APIs you can create with the _API Designer_:

* *External APIs*: To reach web services outside the DXP - Open Edition.
* *Table Definitions*: To connect an application to a data table.
* *Server Scripts*: To access one of your server scripts on the DXP - Open Edition.

//Uta: made this a bullet list (use bullet lists for two list items or more) and added the details to the list items. Added article "the" to DXP Open Edition.

== _API Designer_ view
The main view of the _API Designer_ shows a list of both publicly available APIs and your APIs with search options to sort and filter the list.
//Uta: filter instead of sort

You can search for an existing API, look at its configurations, and save it as a Planet 9 file to your local drive.
//Helle@Neptune: does the file extension change? Currently, it's still .planet9
Starting from this view, you can add or import APIs in different file formats and from remote servers.

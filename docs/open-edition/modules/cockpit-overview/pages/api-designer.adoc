With the _API Designer_, you create and configure API definitions.
You can easily define and update APIs at any stage of the designing process.

The _API Designer_ makes APIs reusable for many applications by just adding that API to the application attributes.

The _API Designer_ provides a set of different functionalities all around the creation and configuration of APIs.
You can create new APIs, update existing APIs, or import and export APIs from an external source.

* *External APIs*: Reach web services outside the DXP - Open Edition.

With the __API Designer__ you create and configure API definitions.
You can easily define and update APIs at any stage of designing.

The __API Designer__ makes APIs reusable for many applications by just adding that API to the application attributes.

The _API Designer_ provides a set of different functionalities all around the creation and configuration of APIs.
You can create new APIs, update existing APIs, or import and export APIs from an external source.

== API types
The _API Designer_ shows all available types of APIs. There are three types of APIs you can create with the _API Designer_:

* *External APIs*: To reach web services outside the DXP - Open Edition.
* *Table Definitions*: To connect an application to a data table.
* *Server Scripts*: To access one of your server scripts on the DXP - Open Edition.

== _API Designer_ view
The main view of the _API Designer_ shows a list of both publicly available APIs and your APIs with search options to sort and filter the list.

You can search for an existing API, look at its configurations, and save it as a Planet 9 file to your local drive.
//Helle@Neptune: does the file extension change? Currently, it's still .planet9
Starting from this view, you can add or import APIs in different file formats and from remote servers.

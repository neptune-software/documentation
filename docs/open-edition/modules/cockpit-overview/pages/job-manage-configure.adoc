= Configure a job

Learn how to configure a job and define error notifications.
//In this topic, you learn how...
//You do not define error notifications here, do you? It is only about setting up mail addresses.

//Prerequisite section missing (even if there are no)

== Procedure

. In the Cockpit, navigate to Tools and click *Job Manage*.
//Service names in italics
. Click *Add* to add a new job.
+
*Result*: The Job Manage configuration dialog opens.
//I would call it a "window", according to the terminology list
+
include::ROOT:partial$name-description-package.adoc[tags=*;!package]
//Why not including the "Package" step from the partial here?
. Assign the job to a package of artifacts in *Package*.
. If you want to start the job now, activate *Active*.
//I would not say "now", but "after you created it"
. In *Error Notification*, add email addresses that you want to notify in case of a job error.
. Click *Save*.

== Results

//Helle@Fabian: We should more ore less settle on one type of introductory sentence for task topics.
You can either use the resources stored within Neptune DXP - Open Edition as starting point or write complete new scripts.

== Prerequisites
* You have the _Script Editor_ open.
//Helle@Fabian: Move to steps?
* You have a project open, see xref:script-editor-new.adoc[] or xref:script-editor-open.adoc[].

//@Helle@Fabian: move to step "click new scipts"?
When you open a new project, the entries *Scripts* and *Globals* are entered by default.

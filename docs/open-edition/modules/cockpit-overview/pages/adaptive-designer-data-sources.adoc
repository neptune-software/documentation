= Data sources

Predefined data sources are essential to the adaptive framework.
A table or a server script provides the data for the adaptive applications in the adaptive framework.
You have two options to use data sources in _Adaptive Designer_:

* You can publish tables and server scripts as data sources in the _Connector_ service.
* You can import tables from Excel.

Using tables as data source in _Adaptive Designer_ requires no code for you to get started.
The table metadata such as heading, columns, and so on is automatically imported into the component library.

Using server scripts as data source in _Adaptive Designer_ provides more flexibility.
You can connect to any data source integrating an API into your server script.
However, this assumes a basic knowledge of APIs and server scripts.

= Create an adaptive application based on a server script

Using server scripts as data source in _Adaptive Designer_ provides more flexibility. You can connect to any data source integrating an API into your server script. To build an adaptive application based on a server script, actually two server scripts are required to create a server script that can be connected to _Adaptive Designer_:

* One script providing the metadata that fills the component library with application components.
* One script providing the runtime, when the adaptive application triggers the data call.

== Prerequisites

* You have created and published the required server script in the _Connector_ service.

== Procedure

1. In the shell bar, open the *Application* drop-down menu.
2. Go to *Create*.
3. Name your adaptive application.
4. Choose the adaptive template for your adaptive application.
5. In the field *Connector*, choose your server script.

== Result

* You have created an adaptive application based on a server script.

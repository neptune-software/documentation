With _Deployment Transfer_, you export deployment packages.
To export means that these packages leave the system and are not handled anymore in the usual transfer process that demands approvals.
When you export a deployment package, _Deployment Transfer_ creates a zip file in the planet9 format out of it.
//Todo hendrik: is it correct that you can export any deployment packages? Even the ones that are transfered to systems? And: Is planet9 a kind of zip format?

= Add a footer with a button

In this step, you add a footer bar with a button to update data displayed in your application.

== Prerequisites

* You have done the xref:app-from-scratch-first-configuration.adoc[first configuration of your application].
* You have xref:app-from-scratch-general-structure.adoc[created a general structure for your application].
* You have xref:app-from-scratch-integrate-data.adoc[integrated data from an API].

== Procedure

. On the component library, open *sap.m* > *Application* and drag and drop the *Bar* component onto *oPageStart* in the application tree.

. From the pop-up menu that opens when you drop the component, select *Middle*.
. On the component library, open *sap.m* > *Simple Controls* and drag and drop the *Button* component onto *Middle* in the application tree.
. On the properties pane, open the *Properties* tab.
. In *text*, enter `Update` and in *type*, select *Emphasized* from the list.
+
*Result*: You have added a footer with a button to update the table.
Now you add functionality to the button so that the button makes the API call rather than the table itself.
+
. On the application tree, click *oRestAPI*.
. In the *Attributes* tab on the properties pane, click into the *setInitLoad* field in *Model* and click *Clear*.
//@Neptune: why do you first set it to online? Why do you clear it now? What happens behind the scenes?
//Neptune@Parson: First the table it self calls the api when initiated. Later we add the api call to a button press event.
. On the application tree pane, click *oButton*.
. On the properties pane, open the *Events* tab and enter a name for the *press* event, for example `UpdatePress`.
. Click the *document-text* icon next to the name.

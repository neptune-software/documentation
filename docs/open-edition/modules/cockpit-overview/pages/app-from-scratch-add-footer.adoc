. From the pop-up menu that opens when you drop the component, select *Middle*.
. On the *Reusable component panel*, open *sap.m* > *Simple Controls* and drag and drop the *Button* component onto *Middle* in the *Application component* panel.
. On the *Component properties* panel, open the *Properties* tab.
. In *text*, enter "Update" and in *type*, select *Emphasized* from the list.
+
*Result*: You have added a footer with a button to update the table.
Now you add functionality to the button so that the button makes the API call rather than the table itself.
+
. On the *Application component* panel, click *oRestAPI*.
. In the *Attributes* tab on the *Component properties* panel, click into the *setInitLoad* field in *Model* and click *Clear*.
//@Neptune: why do you first set it to online? Why do you clear it now? What happens behind the scenes?
//Neptune@Parson: First the table it self calls the api when initiated. Later we add the api call to a button press event.
. On the *Application component* panel, click *oButton*.
. On the *Component properties* panel, open the *Events* tab and enter a name for the *press* event, for example "UpdatePress".
. Click the *document-text* icon next to the name.

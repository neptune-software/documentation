= Create a database table in _Table Definition_ and _Table Browser_

In this topic, you learn how to create a database table and fill it with data.

== Prerequisites
* There are no prerequisites.

== Procedure

NOTE: In this procedure we use sample data from the Star Wars universe. You can exchange our data with your data in the procedure.

=== Step 1: Create a new database table in _Table Definition_
//Fabian@Helle: I wouldn't number the steps in the heading.
. Open the Cockpit of Neptune DXP - Open Edition.
. Go to *Tools* and click *Table Definition*.

. Click *Add* to create a new database table.
+
*Result*: The Table Definition configuration dialog opens. You start in the General tab.
. In *Name*, enter a meaningful name that describes the data you will add to the table, for example, "clonetroopers".
//Fabian@Helle: Use correct typographical conventions for values.
. In *Description*, add additional information. This information is displayed in the _Table Browser_.
. If you created a package for your APIs, applications, oData, and mock data before, select the package from the *Package* drop-down menu.
//. Enable Table Audit, added when consequences are clear
. Click *Save*.
+
*Result*: You have added an empty database table. You now can see a number in *ID*.

=== Step 2: Add properties to the database table
//s.o., no numbering

. Navigate to the *Properties* tab.
. Click *+ Add* to add a new column to the table.
. Enter a column name to each column, for example, "name", "number", "rank", and "squad".
//Fabian@Helle: Use correct typographical conventions for values.
. In *Type*, select a data type for the column.
//Helle@Helle: write reference topic on data types and add link here.
. You can enter a *Description* and *Default value*.
//Helle@Neptune: Where does Description appear?
//Neptune@Helle: The description only appears in the table definition
. For columns that can only have unique values, activate *Unique*.
. For columns that can have no value, activate *Nullable*.

*Result*: You have added properties to the database table.

=== Step 3: Add data to the database table in _Table Browser_
//Fabian@Helle: I would put this section into a new topic as it deals with a new tile (and the topic is becoming too long)

. Open the Cockpit of your Neptune DXP - Open Edition.
. Go to *Tools* and click *Table Definition*.

*Result*: The _Table Browser_ opens. You see a list of all table definitions sorted by name.

[TIP]
====
You can hide all table definitions created by others to find your table definition easier. To do that, change the *Updated By* filter to *Me*.

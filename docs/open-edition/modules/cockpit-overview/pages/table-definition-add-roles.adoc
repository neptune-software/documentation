= Define reading and writing rights for a database table

In this topic, you learn how to assign the right to read and edit database tables to certain roles.

Role Read:: Users with the role `Read` can retrieve the data from the database table but not edit it.
Role Write:: Users with the role `Write` can both retrieve and edit data from the database table.
//@Neptune: what if I don't specify anything at all? Is that table then removed from all lists? Do I still see them but cannot use them?

In _Script Editor_, you can create server-side scripts to extend your instance beyond the standard configurations.

_Script Editor_ comes with the following advantages:

* Automate processes by reusing predefined scripts.
* Add functionality to your applications.
* Integrate your instance in an application that is created outside Neptune DXP - Open Edition.
* Avoid time-consuming calculations that blockade your interface.

The runtime for scripts is the Node.js environment.
Scripts run either inside a separate process or as a global process.

You can use APIs, tables, global scripts, and npm modules to create scripts.

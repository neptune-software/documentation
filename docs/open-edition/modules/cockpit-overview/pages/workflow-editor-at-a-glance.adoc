== Task
A task is an activity executed by a script or a user.

=== Script task

In the component properties pane, you define the following properties for a server script:

Name:: Name of the script task.

Description:: Description of the script task.

Server script:: Server script that is stored in the system and that is executed during the workflow.

// Get Data from Workflow, object number/type, value, currency etc.
log.info(JSON.stringify(wfData));

// Set processing true/false - Use 'True' or 'False'. From 2.0.0 boolean values are supported
wfData.result = 'False';

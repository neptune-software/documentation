== Remove lock entries

Sometimes, lock entries cannot be released again. You can remove the lock manually.

IMPORTANT: Only remove lock entries that are no longer valid and can be deleted without disrupting an active process, such as a user session or an update.
Removing a valid lock can result in data loss or inconsistencies.

=== Procedure

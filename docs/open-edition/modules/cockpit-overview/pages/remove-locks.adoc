== Remove lock entries

Sometimes, Neptune DXP - Open Edition does not release lock entries automatically. You can remove the lock manually.

IMPORTANT: Only remove lock entries that are no longer valid and can be deleted without disrupting an active process, such as a user session or an update.
Removing a valid lock can result in data loss or inconsistencies.

=== Procedure
. On the _Cockpit_, navigate to *Monitoring* and open *Lock Entries*.

= Adaptive list

The adaptive list template provides functionalities to create an adaptive application in _Adaptive Designer_ based on the predefined data sources.
In the resulting adaptive application, you can manage data sets in a list-like display. For example:

* Display your data set.
* Sort and filter for specific criteria.
* Run a full text search.

Optionally, you can link adaptive applications created with the adaptive list template to adaptive applications created with the adaptive edit template.

With the _PDF Designer_, you design your own PDF templates.

You can create PDF templates that reflect your own brand and requirements.
You can add images, watermarks, QR codes, tables, headers, footers, and apply your own styles.

Every PDF template is an API endpoint. You define areas on the PDF where you want to include data. These areas are filled with data from any target system that can be reached via API.

You can call a PDF template with a server script from a workflow or an application to build a PDF document.

The components are divided in two sections:

* *Document* components which are valid for your whole document, for example, *Header*, *Footer* or *Background*. These elements can be inserted directly in the *PDF Document* element in the *Document tree* pane.
* *Elements* components which are content related elements, for example, *Text*, *Table* or *ListBulleted*. They can be inserted in the *Content*, *Header* or *Footer* element of the *PDF Document* element.
//TODO Neptune: Only in these elements?

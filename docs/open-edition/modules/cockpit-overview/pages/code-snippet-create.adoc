//TODO Fabian: 1. Bei mir werden die Balken aller Felder auf der rechten Seite abgeschnitten, war das Absicht? 2. Ich w√ºrde recht was vom Rand wegnehmen. Der wird in den Schritten (bis auf Save am Ende) nicht verwendet.
. Enter a name for your snippet. Choose a name that gives a clear indication of the content.
. Enter a description of what the snippet is about.
. Choose a group from the drop-down menu the snippet belongs to.
//Todo Fabian: Name, Description, Grouping in bold? Else we need to define typographic conventions a little more.

[TIP]
====
In the _Script Editor_, you find your created code snippets under *Custom* when you try to insert a new snippet.
//TODO Helle: Clarify where custom code snippets are used in the App Designer.
//Todo Fabian: I only used copied snippets, see app-from-scratch. In the same step you can enter custom snippets, but I think that is not the bst use case. Ask Neptune for better example?
//Todo Fabian: Also removed list in this tip
====
. Click the checkboxes *Use in App Designer* and *Use in Script Editor* to decide if your snippet should be available in the _App Designer_, the _Script Editor_, or in both.
//Todo Fabian: This kind of dialog appears in many services. As far as i know, fields like ID and dates are filled when saved. should we add a Save step (even though it is not necessary) to show the user when these fields are filled? see api-designer-create.
. Click the *Editor* tab.
+
*Result*: The editor window opens.
//Todo fabian: editor tab?
+
. Write your code here.
+

//Helle: base https://community.neptune-software.com/documentation/develop-your-planet9-second-app

In this topic you learn how to start creating an application using the _App Designer_ and get familiar with the *SplitApp* template that comes with the Neptune DXP - Open Edition.

You can follow step-by-step to use a pre-made API or adjust the steps to use an API that you made yourself.


[TIP]
====
Save your new application any time in the process and return to it later.
To continue building your application, open it in the _App Designer_ and click *Toggle to edit mode* on the top menu.

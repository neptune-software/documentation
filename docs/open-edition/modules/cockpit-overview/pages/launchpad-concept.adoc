With the _Launchpad_, you can create, design, and maintain launchpads. It is a browser-based administration tool.
A launchpad is the homepage for DXP - Open Edition applications on mobile and desktop devices.

A launchpad displays tiles.
Each tile represents an application that users can launch.

Tiles can display live status indicators, for example, a number of open tasks.

A launchpad supports role-based access and displays tiles according to user roles.

* Applications are connected to tiles.
* Tiles are bundled in a tile group. A tile should always be connected with a tile group to maintain a parent-child relationship in the launchpad.
* Tile groups can be assigned to other tile group to maintain a multi-level hierarchy.
* Tile groups are added to the launchpad.

== User roles and user groups

* Users and user groups are assigned a specific role.
* Roles are assigned to a tile or a tile group.

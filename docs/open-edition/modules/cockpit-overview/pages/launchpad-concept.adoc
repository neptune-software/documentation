With the _Launchpad_ service, you create, design, and maintain launchpads.

A launchpad is a browser-based administration tool and the homepage for DXP - Open Edition applications on mobile and desktop devices.

A launchpad displays tiles that are part of a tile group.
Each tile represents an application that users can launch.

Tiles can display live status indicators, for example, a number of open tasks.
A launchpad supports role-based access and displays tiles according to user roles.

The following image shows an example of how a launchpad looks like.
//@Fabian:...example of a launchpad.?

== Download
Launchpads are not part of the DXP - Open Edition installation package.
You can download launchpads from the xref:store.adoc[Store].

== How launchpad objects are connected
//Reduce to Launchpad objects? Or maybe Launchpad framework?

A launchpad includes the following objects:

* Applications
* Tiles
* Tile groups

The following image shows the process of how single applications become part of a launchpad.

//@Fabian: I'd redo the image: "cockpit" is irrelevant and confusing (why no cockpit in front of App Designer?) General idea is good though.

. Applications created in the _App Designer_ are connected to tiles.
. Tiles are bundled in a tile group.
A tile must always be assigned to a tile group to maintain a parent-child relationship on the launchpad.
Tile groups can be assigned to other tile groups to maintain a multi-level hierarchy.
. Tile groups are added to the launchpad.

== User roles and user groups

You can control access to launchpads, tiles, or tile groups by assigning roles to users or user groups.

. Users or user groups are assigned a specific role.
. Roles are assigned to a tile or a tile group.
. Each role can access authorized launchpads, tiles, and tile groups.

== Assign objects in a launchpad

A launchpad comes with an assignment mechanisms that connects objects to one another in different ways.

|Assignment task                      |Assign why               |Assign where
|Assign a user or a group to a role     |All users with a specific role can access apps that are assigned to that role     |Go to *Security* > xref:security-user.adoc[User].
|Assign a user to a group    |All users in a specific group can access apps that are assigned to that group     |Go to *Security* > xref:security-user.adoc[User].

|Assign a tile to a role    |Users can access apps in their launchpad. The role of the user must be assigned to the tile  |Go to *Administration* > xref:tiles.adoc[Tiles].

|Assign a tile group to a role    |Users with this role can view the tile group on their launchpad. Users will only see  tiles that have been assigned to a group with the same role     |Go to *Administration* > xref:tile-groups.adoc[Tile Groups].

|Assign a tile and its intent to a tile group    |When users click the tile on the launchpad, the intent resolves into a URL and navigates to the app     |Go to *Administration* > xref:tiles.adoc[Tiles].

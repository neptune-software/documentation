With the _Launchpad_, you can create, design, and maintain launchpads.
A launchpad is a browser-based administration tool and the homepage for DXP - Open Edition applications on mobile and desktop devices.

A launchpad displays tiles that are part of a tile group.
Each tile represents an application that users can launch.

Tiles can display live status indicators, for example, a number of open tasks.
A launchpad supports role-based access and displays tiles according to user roles.

The following image shows an example of how a launchpad looks like.

. Tile groups can be assigned to other tile group to maintain a multi-level hierarchy.
. Tile groups are added to the launchpad.

You can control access to specific launchpads, tiles, or tile groups by assigning roles to users or user groups.

. Users and user groups are assigned a specific role.
. Roles are assigned to a tile or a tile group.

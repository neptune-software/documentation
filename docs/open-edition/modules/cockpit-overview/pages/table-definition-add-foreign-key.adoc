= Add a foreign key to a database table

//@Fabian: step does not really belong to complex task, it's optional. I linked to complex task prereq and put next steps here, but I'm not sure where to put it in nav later. Open for ideas. :D
//So general question would be, where to optional tasks. Will put it on agenda.
//Fabian: Man könnte es in der Navigation eine Ebene weiter einrücken, um das optionale deutlich zu machen

Learn how to integrate a key from another database table to your database table.
//In this topic, you learn...

You add foreign keys to link multiple database tables by using a shared key.

== Prerequisites

* You have xref:table-definition-add-properties.adoc[added properties to the table definition].

== Procedure

. In the Cockpit, go to Tools and click *Table Definition*.
//Richtige Auszeichnungen beachten
. Open your database table.
. Navigate to the *Properties* tab and, on the toolbar, click *Foreign Keys*.

//Screenshot really needed? It should be clear what to click.
+
*Result*: The *Table Definition* dialog opens.
. Click the table you want to take the keys from.
//@Fabian: clear?
//Not really :-) The sequence is clear, but I would add a longer explanation in the introduction to state what you actually do here and why you need to pick a table to take foreign keys.
+
*Result*: The *Foreign Keys* dialog reopens.
// It does not reopen, you get back to the dialog.
. From the dropdown menu on the toolbar, select the column from your current table that you want to bind the keys to.
. Click *+ Add Column*.

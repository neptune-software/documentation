== Cloud Connector
You can install _Cloud connector_ to establish a secure connection from your network to the _Neptune DXP - Open Edition_.
When you enable _Cloud Connector_, _DXP - Open Edition_ provides a dedicated Azure Relay namespace for your account.

Via _:DXP - Open Edition_, Neptune Software offers an easy way to use Azure Relay hybrid connections.

For the Azure Relay namespace you have received you can create one or more hybrid connections.
For each hybrid connection you have to configure the following attributes:
*Namespace*, *Hybrid Connection Name*, *Shared Access Policy Name*, and *Shared Access Policy Key*.

You should use Azure Relay hybrid connections via _DXP Cloud_ when at least one of the following points applies:

* You do not use Microsoft Azure.
* You do not have the skills to manage Azure Relay namespaces and hybrid connections.
* You are already a paying customer of _DXP Cloud_ and you prefer to receive the billing from Neptune Software and not from Microsoft.

If you have specific requirements for the configuration and the set-up of secure connections, you should not use Azure Relay hybrid connections via _DXP Cloud_.

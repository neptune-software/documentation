. In the _API Designer_, click *Add*.
+
*Result*: The API configuration window opens.
You start in the *General* tab.
+
. In *Type*, select *External*.
. In *API format*, Swagger 2.0 is preselected. You can select the newer version, Open API 3.0, here.
. Enter a *Name* for your external API.
. If you created a package or group for your APIs, applications, oData, and mock data before, you can select those from the *Group* or *Package* drop-down menu.
. Enter a short and meaningful *Description* to your API.
. In *Version*, enter a version number, for example, `1.0`, to keep track of changes to the API.
. In *Endpoint*, enter the URL of the external API, for example, `https://swapi.dev/api`.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not put a slash `/` at the end of the endpoint.

. In *Media Type*, define the type of content of your API. This is needed to communicate with your browser. By default, it is `application/json`.

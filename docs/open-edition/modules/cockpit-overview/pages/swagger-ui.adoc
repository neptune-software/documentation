__Swagger UI__ lets you visualize and interact with the resources of APIs without the implementation logic and makes back-end implementation and client-side consumption easy.

You can use __Swagger UI__ to quickly review the REST API.

__Swagger UI__ provides the format for defining the operations of your API in a human and machine-readable way and visualizes these operations to let consumers interact with the different endpoints of the API.

== Features
* Independent: Host your Swagger UI in any environment.
* Human-friendly: Allow developers to effortlessly interact and try out every single operation that your API exposes for easy consumption.
* Easy to navigate: Quickly find and work with resources and endpoints with neatly categorized documentation.
* All-browser support: Cater to every possible scenario with __Swagger UI__ working in all major browsers.

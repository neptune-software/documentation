You make test requests with operations, for example, defined in the _API Designer_ and see the responses of your requests.
When making test requests, you can use operation parameters that you defined in the _API Designer_ or _API Client_.

//@parson: below information was given before and comes from old documentation. I can't find value of this information. As Swagger UI is a service that runs in Open Edition in a browser of choice, I don't think any of the below information is necessary or helpful. Has more marketing character.

_Swagger UI_ provides the format for defining the operations of your API in a human and machine-readable way and visualizes these operations to let consumers interact with the different endpoints of the API.

With _Swagger UI_, you can test APIs.

You make test requests with the parameters defined for each operation of the API and see the responses of your requests.
To perform test requests, you do not need to implement the API, for example, in an application.

You make test requests with operations, for example, defined in the xref:api-designer.adoc[_API Designer_].
When making test requests, you can use operation parameters that you defined in the xref:api-designer.adoc[_API Designer_] or xref:api-client.adoc[_API Client_].

//@parson: below information was given before and comes from old documentation. I can't find value of this information. As Swagger UI is a service that runs in Open Edition in a browser of choice, I don't think any of the below information is necessary or helpful. Has more marketing character. Update: I also found that this is copied from the Swagger UI webpage. We shouldn't use it.

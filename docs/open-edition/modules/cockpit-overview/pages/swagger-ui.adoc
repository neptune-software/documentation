Test APIs via _Swagger UI_.

Make test calls with the parameters defined for each operation of the API and see the responses of your test calls.
You can perform test calls without implementing the API in an application first.

Test calls are based on operations that have been previously defined, for example, in the _API Designer_.
Optionally, you can test operation parameters that you have defined in the _API Designer_ or in the _API Client_.

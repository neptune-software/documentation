//Fabian@Helle: After looking through this topic, I would split it up in three task topics. Now it is too long. It This would also give you the opportunity to add some more context information in the beginning of a topic (for example, what is an API, what is an "operation").

= Create a table definition API with the _API Designer_

//@Neptune: inspired by Neptune e-learning (SWAPI) and Neptune CI (more funny and geeky than serious), I used Star Wars themed sample data. Hope it's okay.

In this topic, you learn how to create an API to communicate with a table definition.

== Prerequisites

* You have created a table definition, for example, in xref:table-definition-create.adoc[_Table Definition_ and _Table Browser_].

== Procedure

=== Step 1: Configure a new API
//Fabian@Helle: s.o., kein Step1, sondern neue Untertopics

. On the Neptune DXP - Open Edition cockpit, go to *Connectivity* and click _API Designer_.
//Fabian@Helle: Das "Neptune DXP - Open Edition" weglassen hier, ist überflüssig. Außerdem "Cockpit"  groß schreiben.
. On the _API Designer_, click *Add*.
+
image::api-designer-add.png[width=400]
+
*Result*: The API configuration dialog opens.
You start in the *General* tab.
+
. In *Type*, select *Table Definition*.
. In *API format*, Swagger 2.0 is preselected. You may select the newer version, Open API 3.0, here.
//Fabian@Helle: Is Open API 3.0 really newer or just different than Swagger 2.0?
//Helle@parson: no context given for API. Add to concept/reference topic, explain there and link here?
//Fabian@Helle: It is not advisable to provide a link inside a step. Users shouldn't jump away when performing a task. Add the link in the context information in the top or in the related topics below (there is no concept/reference regarding APIs yet, is there? I would add some basic information in the concept topic on the API Designer and link there to other parts of the website or even external sources).

. Enter a *Name* for your table definition, for example, `API Clones`.
//Fabian@Helle: Not really necessary to provide an example for a name here, is it? (Although it is a good one :-))
. If you created a package or group for your APIs, applications, oData, and mock data before, you can select those from the *Group* or *Package* drop-down menu.
. Enter a short and meaningful *Description* to your API.
. In *Version*, enter a version number, for example, `1.0`, to keep track of changes to the API.
. In *Media Type*, you define the type of the content of your api. By default it's `application/json`.
//Helle@Neptune: input needed, what exactly can I enter here? Does this refer to the way API, app, and resource communicate, meaning I can enter JSON or XML?
//Neptune@Helle: the media type is needed by the browser to know what kind of content it receives.

. Activate any of the following options that fit your application:
+
--
include::partial$api-designer-create.adoc[tag=!*]
--

. Click *Save*.
+
image::api-designer-save.png[width=400]
//Fabian@Helle: Do we really need that screenshot? Seems quite obvious what to do, isn't it?

*Result*: Your API is saved with the current settings and is added to the library in the _API Designer_. _API Designer_ adds an ID to your API and saves change dates.
//Fabian@Helle: Always use an article before "API Designer"

=== Step 2: Add an operation
//s.o., create new topic and provide some context information about what an "operation" actually is

. Navigate to the *Operations* tab and click *+* to add an operation.
//Fabian@Helle: Maybe add a screenshot here of the "operations" tab?
. In *Path*, enter a slash and the name of your table definition, for example, `/clonetroopers`.
//Fabian@Helle: Leave example away in this topic.
//Fabian@Helle: What about the "chain link" button next to "path"?
. In *Method*, select a method from the list, for example `GET`:
+
--
include::partial$api-operations.adoc[]
--
//Helle@Neptune: Where's the difference between Summary and Description?
//Neptune@Helle: Description = long explanation, Summary = short explanation.
. In *Tags*, enter keywords that describe the resource, for example, `clones`.
//Fabian@Helle: remove example.
. Activate any of the following:
//Helle@Neptune: Save Request Body explanation is assumptions, please check.
//Fabian@Helle: In my version, there is no "Save Request Body" button at all. Has it vanished or is it only displayed if you do something else before?
** Trace Operations: Trace request you or others make to the API in _API Trace_.
** Save Request Body: When you trace operations, the request details are traced, too.
** Send Credentials (cookie): Use credentials for cookie-based authorization.
** Use Example Data: Use example data to run an unfinished API in the _App Designer_. Example data is not traced in _API Trace_ or _API Client_.
//Helle@Neptune: Add: Click *Save*?
//Fabian@Helle: I would add that.
//Neptune@Hello: Yes

=== Step 3: Add a definition and property
//Fabian@Helle: s.o., new topic.

. Navigate to the *Definitions* tab and click *+* to add a definition.
//Fabian@Helle: Would add a screenshot here.
. Enter a *Name*, for example, `clones`, and *Description*.
//Fabian@Helle: Remove example.
. Select a *Type*.
//Helle@Neptune: What does the type do?
//Fabian@Helle: Funny again, I cannot select a "type" at all, has something changed in between?
//Neptune@Helle: I don´t know :D Seems to be removed.

. Navigate to the *Properties* tab and click *+ Add*.
+
*Result*: The _API Designer_ adds a new line to specify a property.
//Fabian@Helle: Screenshot needed

. For each property, enter a *Name* that indicates what kind of information the property will hold, for example, `name`, `number`, `rank`, and `squad`.
//Fabian@Helle: Remove examples.
. Select the allowed *Type* for the property.
. Enter a *Description*.
. If you want the property to be mandatory, check the *Required* box.
. Click *Save*.

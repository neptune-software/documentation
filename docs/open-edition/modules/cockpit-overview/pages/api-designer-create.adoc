= Create a table definition API with the _API Designer_

//@Neptune: inspired by Neptune e-learning (SWAPI) and Neptune CI (more funny and geeky than serious), I used Star Wars themed sample data. Hope it's okay.

In this topic, you learn how to create an API to communicate with a table definition.

== Prerequisites

* You have created a table definition, for example, in xref:table-definition-create.adoc[_Table Definition_ and _Table Browser_].

== Procedure

=== Step 1: Configure a new API

. On the Neptune DXP - Open Edition cockpit, go to *Connectivity* and click _API Designer_.
. On the _API Designer_, click *Add*.
+

+
*Result*: The API configuration dialog opens.
You start in the *General* tab.
+
. In *Type*, select Table Definition.
. In *API format*, Swagger 2.0 is preselected. You can select the newer version, Open API 3.0, here.
//Helle@parson: no context given for API. Add to concept/reference topic, explain there and link here?

. Enter a *Name* for your table definition, for example, `API Clones`.

. If you created a package or group for your APIs, applications, oData, and mock data before, you can select those from the *Group* or *Package* drop-down menu.
. Enter a short and meaningful *Description* to your API.
. In *Version*, enter a version number, for example, `1.0`, to keep track of changes to the API.
. In *Media Type*,
//Helle@Neptune: input needed, what exactly can I enter here? Does this refer to the way API, app, and resource communicate, meaning I can enter JSON or XML?

. Activate any of the following options that fit your application:
+
--
include::partial$api-designer-create.adoc[tag=!*]
--

. Click *Save*.
+

*Result*: Your API is saved with the current settings and is added to the library in the _API Designer_. _API Designer_ adds an ID to your API and saves change dates.

=== Step 2: Add an operation

. Navigate to the *Operations* tab and click *+* to add an operation.
. In *Path*, enter a slash and the name of your table definition, for example, `/clonetroopers`.
. In *Method* select a method from the list, for example `GET`:
+
--
include::partial$api-operations.adoc[]
--
//Helle@Neptune: Where's the difference between Summary and Description?
. In *Tags*, enter keywords that describe the resource, for example, `clones`.
. Activate any of the following:
//Helle@Neptune: Save Request Body explanation is assumptions, please check.
** Trace Operations: Trace request you or others make to the API in _API Trace_.
** Save Request Body: When you trace operations, the request details are traced, too.
** Send Credentials (cookie): Use credentials for cookie-based authorization.
** Use Example Data: Use example data to run an unfinished API in the App Designer. Example data is not traced in _API Trace_ or _API Client_.

=== Step 3: Add a definition and property

. Navigate to the *Definitions* tab and click *+* to add a definition.
. Enter a *Name*, for example, `clones`, and *Description*.
. Select a *Type*.
//Helle@Neptune: What does the type do?

. Navigate to the *Properties* tab and click *+ Add*.
+
*Result*: The _API Designer_ adds a new line to specify a property.

. For each property, enter a *Name* that indicates what kind of information the property will hold, for example, `name`, `number`, `rank`, and `squad`.
. Select the allowed *Type* for the property.
. Enter a *Description*.
. If you want the property to be mandatory, check the *Required* box.
. Click *Save*.

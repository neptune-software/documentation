*Result*: The _API Designer_ adds a new line to specify a property.

. For each property, enter a *Name* that indicates what kind of information the property will hold, for example, `planet`, and `characters`.
. Select the allowed *Type* for the property.

TIP: If you select `Array` or `Object`, go to the Actions column and click *+* to add sub-properties to the property.

. Enter a *Description*.
. If you want the property to be mandatory, activate the *Required* box.
. Click *Save*.

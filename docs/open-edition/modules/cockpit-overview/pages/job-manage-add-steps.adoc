= Add steps to a job

In this topic, you learn how to add one or more server scripts as steps to a job and define how and in which order these server scripts are executed when the job is triggered.

== Prerequisites

* You have xref:job-manage-schedule.adoc[defined the schedule of a job].
* You have created one or more server scripts you want to include in the job.

== Procedure

. In the Cockpit, go to *Tools* and click _Job Manage_.
. From the job table, click your job to open it.
+
include::ROOT:partial$tip-filter-by-me.adoc[]
+
. Navigate to the *Steps* tab.
. In the table toolbar, click *+Add* to add a new server script.
+
*Result*: The *Server Script* dialog opens.
. Go to your server script project, expand the project and click the server script.
+
*Result*: The table adds a row with the details of the server script.

. In *Error Handling*, define the next action in case of a server script error.
. Repeat for each server script you want to include in the job.
. Click *Save*.
//@Neptune: I do not have to press "Run" (next to +Add in the Steps tab) to make it work, correct? When I press Run, it says "job already running". I assume, I don't have to press it here?

== Results
* You have added one or more steps to a job.

= image:tile-icon.png[width=100] Tiles

A tile is a container that represents an application on the launchpad. With _Tiles_, you can create, assing, and maintain tiles.

All applications on the launchpad have at least one corresponding tile. As tiles are used to display and launch apps on the launchpad, they should only be used there and nowhere else.
You can bundle tiles in tile groups.

Depending on the application, a tile can show the following content:

* Icon
* Title
* Informative text
* Numbers
* Charts
* Links

The following picture shows an example of a launchpad with tiles.

//@Neptune: Can we perhaps show another example with most of the content mentioned above and explain what is shown on the tile? See also Helle's comment.
//Neptune@Parson: Here you find other screenshots https://community.neptune-software.com/documentation/creating-and-configuring-tile#Overview
Below the tile area, tiles can include a link.
Links consist of a title and an optional subtitle.
Most tile types can be converted to links.
Links can be converted to tiles at any time.
//Neptune@Parson: What is this text about? A link can be converted to a tile and vice versa? I don't understand that.
//TODO Neptune: What are the different types of tiles?
//Neptune@Parson: See the link above.

Users can personalize their launchpad by selecting the tiles for the applications they want to use from the store.

== Responsiveness
The number of tiles that a launchpad shows depends on the screen resolution.
If tiles in a group do not fit next to each other, the launchpad moves them to the next row.
Tiles also appear smaller on smartphones.

Tiles are not responsive.
For smartphones, Neptune provides a different tile size.
The _Launchpad_ automatically renders the tile size for smartphones.
Tiles for smartphones do not need to be adjusted by the application.
The tile size for tablets and desktop devices is the same.

The example below shows how the tiles rendered for smaller screen size.

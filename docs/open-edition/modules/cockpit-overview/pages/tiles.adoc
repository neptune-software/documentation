A tile is a container that represents an application on a xref:launchpad.adoc[_Launchpad_].
//@Neptune. Links to topics that have not been published do not work yet.
All applications have at least one corresponding tile.
You can bundle tiles in xref:tile-groups.adoc[_Tile groups_].

You use tiles to assign actions and role-based access.
Therefore, do not use tiles on an overview page or anywhere else.
//@Neptune: Do we need the last sentence of above paragraph? What does overview page mean?

An action can be an adaptive framework, an application, or a link.
//@Neptune. Information on role-based access here? It is described in launchpad.adoc. Should we reference to it or add it here?

Depending on the application, a tile can show the following content:

* Icon
* Title
* Informative text
* Numbers
* Charts
* Links

The following picture shows an example of a launchpad with tiles.

//@Neptune: Can we perhaps show another example with most of the content mentioned above and explain what is shown on the tile? See also Helle's comment.

Below the tile area, tiles can include a link.
Links consist of a title and an optional subtitle.
Most tile types can be converted to links.
Links can be converted to tiles at any time.
//@Neptune. What are the different types of tiles?

Users can personalize their launchpad by selecting the tiles for the applications they want to use from the store.

== Responsiveness
The number of tiles that a launchpad shows depends on the screen resolution.
If tiles in a group do not fit next to each other, the launchpad moves them to the next row.
Tiles also appear smaller on smartphones.

Tiles are not responsive.
For smartphones, Neptune provides a different tile size.
The __Launchpad__ automatically renders the tile size for smartphones.
Tiles for smartphones do not need to be adjusted by the application.
The tile size for tablets and desktop devices is the same.

The example below shows how the tiles rendered for smaller screen size.

== Tile blackout
You can block tiles from being used during maintenance. See xref:tile-blackout.adoc[Tile blackout].

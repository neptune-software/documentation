A tile is a container that represents an app on a xref:launchpad.adoc[_Launchpad_].
All apps have at least one corresponding tile.
You can bundle tiles in xref:tile-groups.adoc[_Tile groups_].

You use tiles to assign actions and role-based access.
Therefore, do not use tiles on an overview page or anywhere else.
//@Neptune: Do we need above sentence?

An action can be an adaptive framework, an application, or a link.

//@Neptune. Information on role-based access needed.

Depending on the application, a tile can show the following content:

* icon
* title
* informative text
* numbers
* charts
* links

Below the tile area, tiles can include a link.
Links consist of a title and an optional subtitle.
Most tile types can be converted to links.
Links can be converted to tiles at any time.

Users can personalize their homepage by selecting the tiles for the applications they want to use from the store.

== Responsiveness
The number of tiles that a launchpad shows depends on the screen resolution.
If tiles in a group do not fit next to each other, the launchpad moves them to the next row.
Tiles also appear smaller on smartphones.

Tiles are not responsive.
For smartphones, Neptune provides a different tile size.
The __Launchpad__ automatically renders the tile size for smartphones.
Tiles for smartphones do not need to be adjusted by the application.
The tile size for tablets and desktop devices is the same.

The example below shows how the tiles rendered for smaller screen size.

//General comment from Fabian: You should also write the service overview topic "tools.adoc" and give an overview about the four services

= image:job-log-icon.png[width=70] Job Log

With _Job Log_, you can view the history and status of background jobs.

You create background jobs in _Job Manage_ and integrate them in your applications.
The _Job Log_ service displays the logs of all background jobs in a table.

You can use filters from the table toolbar to define a time period, job, and job status to only show specific logs.
If you want to find out more about a single log entry, click the *info* icon in the log entry's row.

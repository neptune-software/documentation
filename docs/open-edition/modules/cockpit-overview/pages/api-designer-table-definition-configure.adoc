= Configure a table definition

In this topic, you learn how to configure an API to communicate with a table definition.

== Prerequisites

* You have created a table definition, for example, in xref:table-definition-create.adoc[Table Definition and Table Browser].

== Procedure

NOTE: In this procedure we use sample data from the Star Wars universe. You can exchange our data with your data in the procedure.

. In the Cockpit, go to *Connectivity* and click _API Designer_.
. In the _API Designer_, click *Add*.
+
*Result*: The API configuration dialog opens.
You start in the *General* tab.
+
. In *Type*, select *Table Definition*.
. In *API format*, Swagger 2.0 is preselected. You can select the newer version, Open API 3.0, here.
. Enter a *Name* for your table definition, for example, `API Clones`.
. If you created a package or group for your APIs, applications, oData, and mock data before, you can select those from the *Group* or *Package* drop-down menu.
. Enter a short and meaningful *Description* to your API.
. In *Version*, enter a version number, for example, `1.0`, to keep track of changes to the API.
. In *Media Type*, define the type of content of your api. This is needed to communicate with your browser. By default, it is `application/json`.

. Activate any of the following options that fit your application:

. Click *Save*.


== Result

* Your API is saved with the current settings and is added to the library in the _API Designer_.

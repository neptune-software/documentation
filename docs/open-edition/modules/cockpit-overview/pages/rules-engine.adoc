_Rules Engine_ allows you to define JSON structured business rules in an easy-to-use no-code UI.

These rules essentially take an input, compare it against any number of conditions, and return an output based on which conditions have been met.

This separation of concerns, allows you to implement a rule within scripts or processes, and then simply adjust the rule to change the outcome - rather than having to dig into code and adjust hard-coded values.

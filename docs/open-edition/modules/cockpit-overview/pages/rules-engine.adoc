With _Rules Engine_, you can create JSON structured business rules without the need to write code yourself.

These rules take an input, compare it against any number of conditions, and return an output based on which conditions have been met.

With this approach, you can implement a rule within scripts or processes.
Then you can adjust the rule to change the output and do not have to change the code.
//todo Fabian: Why would I want to adjust a rule? Maybe (with or without reason): If you want to change the output (later), for example, *insert reason here*, you can adjust the rule and do not have to change the code/adjust the rule without having to change the code.

It is furthermore possible to call rules like an API inside a script.

== Process of creating rules

To create rules, you define attributes. These attributes define the data that are accepted by the logic of the rule.
Learn here how to create attributes: xref:rules-engine-conditions.adoc[]
//todo Fabian: without "here"?

These attributes are used in a variety of conditions.

//todo Fabian: without "here"?

Each rule can have any number of conditions. Rules follow these rules:

* Conditions are read from top to bottom.
* Each condition is treated as an `If` statement, where the incoming data is checked against the specified condition.
* If the condition is met, the `Then` result is returned. The rule is completed.
* If the condition is not met, the next condition in the sequence is checked.
* If no conditions are met, the rule returns `False`.
* Each condition is a group, which can contain multiple clauses.
* When there are multiple clauses in one group, each condition within the group is compared with an `and`.

The following is an example with three condition groups.
The incoming data is passed through each group.
If the criteria are met, the `Then` data is output for that condition.
If all conditions are checked and no conditions met, the rule will output `False`:

//Fabian: I took the example from the existing documentation from Lloyd, seems good to me.
The example returns the following values in the *Test* tab:

[%header, cols="^,^,^"]

|""     |20     |Entry Granted

|James  |25     |Entry Granted

|Bob    |30     |VIP Entry Granted

|Bob    |17     |No Entry

|""     |""     |False

Neptune DXP Open Edition uses connectors to create an abstraction of the data sources for __Adaptive Designer__ applications.

In __Connector__, you publish the data sources that are used in the link:adaptive-designer.adoc[Adaptive Designer].

Multiple _Adaptive Designer_ applications can use connectors.

Connectors support table or server script data sources from previous versions of Neptune DXP Open Edition.
//@Neptune: What does "previous" refer to, a previous version?

You can preview connectors to see the type of data that the connector produces.

Connectors can include a full RTE documentation.
//@Neptune: RTE = run-time environment?

A group holds some or all the resources that you need for a solution.
Groups help you maintain an overview of all the different APIs and the OData for a solution.
You can create several groups.

Groups also help you in the https://community.neptune-software.com/documentation/deployment-2[deployment] process.

You can add APIs and OData to a group in the API Designer or the OData source.

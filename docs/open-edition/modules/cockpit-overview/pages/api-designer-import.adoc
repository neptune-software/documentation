= Import an API with the _API Designer_

You use APIs to communicate with data formats.
In this topic, you learn how to import different files that you want to connect an API to.
You can import files from inside and outside Neptune DXP - Open Edition.

//Helle@Fabian: used collapsables, makes sense? Thought 3 separate topics would be too much for an import. Might be a little complicated with the nested lists though.
//Fabian@Helle: Looks good in IntelliJ, have to wait how it is rendered in HTML.

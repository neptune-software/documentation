= Cockpit search function

The cockpit consists of many services. To facilitate finding the correct service or artifact, you should primarily use the search function.
There are two ways to open the window for the search:

* Click the search field in the shell bar on the very top of the cockpit. It is always displayed there if you are in the cockpit. You can open the search bar from most services as well.
* Click `Alt + S` in the cockpit.

= Cockpit search function

The Cockpit consists of many services. To facilitate finding the correct service or artifact, use the search function.
There are two ways to open the window for the search:

* Click the search field in the shell bar on the top of the Cockpit.
The search field is available in the Cockpit and most services.
It is not available in editor services that had to be opened in a new window or new tab, for example, the _App Designer_ or the _Script Editor_.
* Click `Alt + S` for Windows and `Option + S` for Mac in the cockpit.

With _Table Browser_, you can view and maintain data of database tables.
The _Table Browser_ service shows both publicly available database tables and those you created with _Table Definition_.
//Fabian: Are they "publicly" available? General: Do you need the second sentence at all (it seems obvious to me)

You can open a database table, view its metadata and add, edit, or delete data records.
In your database, you can run a number of columns to test your definition and see data records.

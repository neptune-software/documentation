== Procedure

1. In the shell bar, open the *Application* drop-down menu.
2. Go to *Create*.
3. Name your adaptive application.
4. Choose the adaptive template for your adaptive application.
5. In the field *Connector*, choose your table definition.

== Result

* You have created an adaptive application based on a table definition.

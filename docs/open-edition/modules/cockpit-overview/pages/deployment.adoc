= Deployment

Deployment is a methodology to distribute services from one Neptune DXP edition to another.
//Sentence sounds too complicated. Better: "Deployment is a method of distributing services from one Neptune DXP edition to another."
//"Services" or "Packages"?
The deployment services allow you to create deployment packages and transfer them from one system to another.
//Explain better what happened in what step of the deployment process.

Deployment packages contain development artefacts such as _Launchpad_, _Tile Group_, _Tile_, _Application_, _Theme_, _OData_, _Table_, and so on.
//Artifacts are created using these services, the services are not the artifacts
//Typo: Artefacts

//I would list all the deployment topics here in a "related topics" section

= Deployment

Deployment is a methodology to distribute services from one Neptune DXP edition to another. The deployment services allow you to create deployment packages and transfer them from one system to another.

Deployment packages contain development artefacts such as _Launchpad_, _Tile Group_, _Tile_, _Application_, _Theme_, _OData_, _Table_, and so on.

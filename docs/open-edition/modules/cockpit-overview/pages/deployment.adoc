= Deployment

Deployment is a method of distributing packages from one Neptune DXP edition to another.

The deployment services allow you to create deployment packages, transfer them from one system to another, and if configured to approve their transfer. Further, they enable you to define deployment routes.

Deployment packages contain development artifacts from services such as _Launchpad_, _Tile Group_, _Tile_, _Application_, _Theme_, _OData_, _Table_, and so on.

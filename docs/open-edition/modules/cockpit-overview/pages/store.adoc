The _Store_ is the Neptune portal to download and publish application building blocks.

The _Store_ provides free building blocks, templates, and APIs for your instance.
Any item you download is ready to use or modify in your instance.

You can publish new application building blocks to the store, or you can use the available applications from the _Store_.
The tools _API Designer_ and _App Designer_ use the _Store_ to publish or download APIs or applications.

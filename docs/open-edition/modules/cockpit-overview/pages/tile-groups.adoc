A _Tile group_  includes several tiles and is displayed on the __Launchpad__.
A user must have the same role as the tile group to see the group.
//@Neptune. Is that also true of tiles?

//@Neptune. Can we show an example of a tile group?

== Role-based tile groups
You can bundle tiles into tile groups and assign one or more roles to each tile group.
This way, you do not need to assign a role to each tile.

Users who are assigned to a role in a tile group have access to the applications of that tile group.
They also can browse through a tile group library from their _Launchpad_ and select the applications that they want to display on the homepage of their _Launchpad_.

== Manage tile groups
You manage tile groups on the __Cockpit__ in *Administration*.

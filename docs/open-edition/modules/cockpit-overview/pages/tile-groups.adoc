With the _Tile group_, you can maintain groups of tiles and role-based access.
_Tile groups_ includes several tiles and is displayed on the launchpad.
A user must have the same role as the tile group to see the group.

//TODO Neptune: Can we show an example of a tile group?
//Neptune@Parson: Sure

== Role-based tile groups
You can bundle tiles into tile groups and assign one or more roles to each tile group.
In this way, you do not need to assign a role to each tile.

Users who are assigned to a role in a tile group have access to the applications of that tile group.
They also can browse through a tile group library from their _Launchpad_ and select the applications that they want to display on the homepage of their _Launchpad_.

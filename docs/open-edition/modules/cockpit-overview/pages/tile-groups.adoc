With _Tile Group_, you can maintain groups of tiles and role-based access.
_Tile Group_ includes several tiles and is displayed on the launchpad.
A user must have the same role as the tile group to see the group.

== Role-based tile groups
You have to bundle tiles into tile groups to make them appear on the launchpad. Tiles can only appear there if they are part of a tile group.

You can assign one or more roles to each tile group.
In this way, you do not need to assign a role to each tile.

Users who are assigned to a role in a tile group have access to the applications of that tile group.
They can also browse through a tile group library from their launchpad and select the applications that they want to display on the startpage of their launchpad.

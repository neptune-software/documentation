With _Tile Group_, you can maintain groups of tiles and define role-based access.
Tile groups include several tiles and are displayed on the launchpad.
You have to bundle tiles into tile groups to make them appear on the launchpad.
//Meaning you can only use tiles in a launchpad that are assigned to a group, or you can only use multiple tiles in a launchpad if they are assigned to the same group?
Tiles can only appear on the launchpad if they are part of a tile group.

== Role-based tile groups

//You can assign one or more roles to a tile group to restrict access to specific user groups. Only users with the same role can see tiles that belong to this tile group. Roles assigned to a tile group also apply to its tiles. You do not need to assign roles to individual tiles.
A user must have the same role as the tile group to see it.
You can assign one or more roles to each tile group.
In this way, you do not need to assign a role to each tile.

//necessary? I think your text explains it well enough.
Users who have assigned a role in a tile group have access to the applications of that tile group.
//Users who share a role with the tile group...?
They can also browse through a tile group library from their launchpad and select the applications that they want to display on the start page of their launchpad.

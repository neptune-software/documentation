= Create an application from scratch

In this topic you learn how to create an application that displays data using a Rest API.

You can follow step-by-step to use a pre-made API or adjust the steps to use an API that you made yourself.

//Helle@Neptune: I used the API from Lloyd's e-Learning programme instead of the API from the original documentation. This is easier for user since Lloyd's API is available to them, meaning that they can decide whether to use their own or Lloyd's API. Providing an API for this guide also ensures that newbies can get starting without having to build an API first.

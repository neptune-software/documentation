Monitor active user sessions in the system.
//Todo Neptune: I adapted the description to match the verbal style of service descriptions. Alternatively: Check a list of active user sessions in the system. Does it make sense to adapt the service description on the service tile?

A user session starts when a user signs in to the Cockpit, and it stops when the user signs out again. A user session can also be terminated automatically when the user is inactive for a certain period of time. This specific session timeout can be configured in _System Settings_.
//Leonie: I am wondering if it should state System Settings service, because we are referring to another service.
//Todo Leonie: Find a concept how to mention and refer inbetween services.

_User Sessions_ provides live data on the following:

* The amount of active user sessions in the system
* The login provider of an active user session
* The username that is signed in
* The expiration date of an active user session

//Todo Neptune: I used the term login provider instead of source to clearly make a connection between sign in data fields and the user session data fields. Does it make sense to adapt the column title from source to login provider here?
//Todo Neptune: What values except from local can we expect as a source? Can we differ local and cloud providers or similar?
//Todo Neptune: I used the term expiration date to go with a nominal style for the live data. Does it make sense to adapt the column title "Expires" accordingly?

You can also search for a specific source or username and filter the overview accordingly.

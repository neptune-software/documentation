_User Sessions_ lets you monitor active user sessions in the system.
A user session starts when a user signs in to the Cockpit and it stops when the user signs off again.
//Todo Leonie: Discuss terminology sign in vs. log in

You can find the following details about active user sessions:

* Total
* Source
* Username
* Expiry
//Todo Leonie: Decide if we need more information here. I think it would just state the obvious. Remark: When signing in the Login Provider equals the Source in the table?

You can also search for a specific source or username and filter the overview accordingly.

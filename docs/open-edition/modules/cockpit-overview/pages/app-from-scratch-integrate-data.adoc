= Integrate data from an API

In this example, we use an API with equipment details.
We integrate the data in a table for an exemplary equipment overview.

== Prerequisites

* You have done the xref:app-from-scratch-first-configuration.adoc[first configuration of your application].
* You have xref:app-from-scratch-general-structure.adoc[created a general structure for your application].

== Procedure

. On the component library, open *sap.m* > *Table Responsive* and drag and drop the *Table* component onto *oPageStart* in the application tree.
. On the UI object pane, name your *Table* `oTableEquipment`.
. On the component library, open *Resources* and drag and drop the *RestAPI* component onto *Resources* in the application tree.
. On the UI object pane, click the *Rest API* field to open the Rest API library.
. Search either for your API or `API 1equipment`.
. Click on the operation with the *GET* *Method*.

//@Neptune: in my test runs the Operation field in the UI object pane was preselected when selecting the API. In the e-Learning, it needs to be set manually. Which one is the expected behaviour?
//Neptune@Parson: In the Api selection dialog an api will be selected by choosing the operation you want to perform. So the operation will be filled automatically.
+
*Result*: You have integrated a table, a *Rest API*, and an *Operation*.
Now you bind the *Rest API* to the table to display data in your table.
+
. On the UI object pane, click the *API* tab and navigate to *Response* > *200*.
. Click into the field that matches the *Operation* of your API and select your table from the list.
In our example, it is `oTableEquipment`.
. On the *Model* tab, click into the *setInitLoad* field and select *online* from the list.

. On the application tree pane, select *oTableEquipment*.
. On the UI object pane, click into the *Model Source* field, and from the *Binding* pop-up window, select the property from your API.
In our example, it is `1equipment`.
. Right-click *oTableEquipment*, and from the drop-down menu, select *Wizard* > *Insert Fields - Edit*.
. In the *Wizard* window, check all properties you want to display in the table and click *Create*.

. On the top menu, click *Save* and *Activate*.

*Result*: For each property you selected, a column component is added to your *Table* component.
To see the changes, restart the preview as described in xref:app-from-scratch-preview.adoc[].

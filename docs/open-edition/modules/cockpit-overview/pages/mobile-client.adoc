A mobile client is the mobile version of a launchpad. With _Mobile Client_, you create and maintain a launchpad for mobile devices.

The _Mobile Client_ uses Apache Cordova plugins to create mobile applications.
Apache Cordova provides a way to develop mobile applications using standard web technologies, for example, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

DXP - Open Edition supports the following Apache Cordova plugins that can be added to the mobile client:

cordova-plugin-camera:: Take pictures with the device camera.
cordova-plugin-cookiemaster:: Enables the management of cookies in WebViews on iOS and Android.
cordova-plugin-device:: Get device information.
cordova-plugin-dialogs:: Use native dialog UI elements.

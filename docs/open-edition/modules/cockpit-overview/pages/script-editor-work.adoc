= Work with the Script Editor

After setting up a project and creating a new script, you can now start working with it.

* You can write the code that should be run in the script editing panel.
* You can use a large number of existing scripts to start.
* You can also add predefined resources to your script and process them.
* You can run the script when you are finished.

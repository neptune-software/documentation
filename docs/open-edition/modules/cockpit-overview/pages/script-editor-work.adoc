= Creating code with the Script Editor

After setting up a project and creating a new script, you can start creating code with the _Script Editor_.

* You can write the code that should be run in the script editing panel.
* You can add other resources from DXP - Open Edition to your script and work with them.
* You can use a large number of existing code snippets.
* You can run the script when you are finished.

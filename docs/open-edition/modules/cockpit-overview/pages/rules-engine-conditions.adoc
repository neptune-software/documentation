. Click the *Interface* tab.
. Click *+Add*.
+
*Result*: A new empty row appears.
. Fill in the data for the attribute.

//"Open Edition" seems lost without the rest of the title. It'd delete completely. This 1. might apply to both SAP and OE and 2. is not necessary for the task. User who end up here, already selected OE documentation.
//After reviewing next steps: screenshots are cut differently though they provide the same information. Users most likely see these topics in succession, I'd use the same cut.
. Create as many attributes as you need for your purpose.
+
TIP: You can sort rows by dragging and dropping them.
. Click *Save*.

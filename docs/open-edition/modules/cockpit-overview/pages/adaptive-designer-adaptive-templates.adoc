//concept of two different adaptive templates and xref to single types
//TODO Leonie: fill topic

_Adaptive Designer_ comes with templates that represent the foundation and structure for different types of adaptive applications.
Because an adaptive application is based on an adaptive template, any changes you make to the adaptive template will reflect across all the adaptive applications that use it.
//TODO Leonie: What does it mean - change the template ? changes are most likely not done in the adaptive designer, correct? Bring section to introduction in overview, if essential.

You can choose from two main types of adaptive templates that offer further subtypes of adaptive templates:

* Adaptive application templates:
** Adaptive list
** Adaptive edit
** Analytic slice and dice
* Adaptive tile templates:
** Adaptive tile chart
** Adaptive tile table

//TODO Leonie: prepare slice and dice terminology; real Names to be used? add to terminology list; could be introduced with the store before the list, then it makes more sense to use the real names and list where everything belongs to...

//TODO Leonie: explain each type in the following

= Adaptive tile chart

The adaptive tile chart template provides functionalities to create an adaptive application in _Adaptive Designer_ based on the predefined data sources that runs directly within a tile in a launchpad.

The resulting adaptive application displays real-time data in a specific chart similar to adaptive applications created with the analytic slice and dice template. However, you cannot further customize or edit the visualized data on the tile.

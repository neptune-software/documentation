= Create a background job

In this guide, you learn how to create a background job with one or more server scripts that you can integrate in an application.

//Helle@Neptune: I didn't find anything on how to integrate a job. That is worth a topic. I guess, you do it in App Designer when creating an application?
//Fabian: As far as I understand it, "Jobs" run independent of apps. They are scripts (or batch files) that are started at a certain time and run for a certain time.

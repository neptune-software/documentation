_Mobile Debug_ lets you debug mobile applications and trace logs generated from mobile applications.

You can create new mobile debuggers, assign users that access the application, and check the log when debugging is required.

You can edit mobile debuggers and delete them.

//Comment FaKo: The information on https://community.neptune-software.com/documentation/mobile-debug are not really about "working with mobile debugger". They are more about creating and deleting them. Shouldn't we create such topics also, so we will have three topics (1. Create; 2. Work with; 3. Delete)?

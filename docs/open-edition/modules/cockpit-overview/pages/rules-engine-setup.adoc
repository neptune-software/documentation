In this topic, you learn how to set up a rule in the _Rules Engine_.
//Helle@Fabian: changed setup (noun) > set up (verb) in title and sentence

== Prerequisites
* There are no prerequisites.

== Procedure

. On the Cockpit, go to *Development* and click _Rules Engine_.
//Todo Fabian: not have non-clickable UI elements in bold?
+
*Result*: You see all rules available in the system.
. Click *Add*.
+
*Result*: A new window opens.
//Todo Fabian: not a window following our definition. I extended the terminology list. See dialog, wizard, window (also added to agenda). wizard was admitted for special cases before, but we have a gap here.

. Enter a *Name* and a *Description* for your rule.
. Select a *Package* the rule should belong to.
//changed choose > select, see terminology list
//todo Fabian: just belongs to? You either know which one it belongs to (even though it's not defined yet) or you don't, then you don't do anything here.
+
TIP: Selecting a package facilitates deployment by combining data from the same package.
//todo Fabian: Yey, partial potential! Package appears in almost every wizard. We should align, how we explain this. Maybe we can even use a partial for name-descr-package.
//Added bold to field names above
. Click the *Role* tab.
. Click *+Add*.
+
*Result*: A new window with all available roles in the system opens.
. Click on a role. Your rule will now only be available for users that have this role assigned.
//todo Fabian: What do people with the role do with the rule? Is this maybe worth explaining in concept topic?
//also change "roll" to "role" ;)
+
TIP: You can use the _Role_ service to define or change roles.
//if connection between rules engine and role is explained in concept, we might not need it here.
. Click *Save*.
*Result*: _Rules Engine_ adds an ID to your rules and saves change dates.

== Results
* You have made the initial setup for your role and can now start to add attributes and conditions.

//todo Fabian: Next steps section? This is what I used in Installation topics. Else: mention next step first, then additional topics (=role)?

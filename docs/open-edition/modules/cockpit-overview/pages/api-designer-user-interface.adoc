= API Designer user interface

The start page of the _API Designer_ shows a list of both publicly available APIs and your APIs with search options to sort and filter the list.

You can search for an existing API, look at its configurations, apply changes, and save it as a `.planet9` file to your local disk.
//@Neptune: does the file extension change? Currently, it's still .planet9
//Neptune@Parson: No it doesn't change.
Starting from this view, you can add or import APIs in different file formats and from remote servers.

= API Designer user interface

The start page of the _API Designer_ shows a list of both publicly available APIs and your APIs with search options to sort and filter the list.

//Fabian: Maybe insert another callout to the button on the top right where you can show more data columns regarding the API?

You can search for an existing API, look at its configurations, apply changes, and save it as a Planet 9 file to your local disk.
//@Neptune: does the file extension change? Currently, it's still .planet9
//Neptune@Parson: No it doesn't change.
//Fabian: We should write names of file as code, according to the style guide (`planet9`)
Starting from this view, you can add or import APIs in different file formats and from remote servers.

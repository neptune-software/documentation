= Add a definition and properties to an external API

Definitions let you define how a response of an API looks like.
To simplify the work when you integrate data from an API into an application, create a definition for each possible response the API gives.

In this task, you learn how to add a definition to an external API manually.
With many APIs, you can import definition or derive definitions from sample requests.

*Result*: The _API Designer_ adds a new line to specify a property.

. For each property, enter a *Name* that indicates what kind of information the property will hold, for example, `title`, `episode_id`, `producer`, and `characters`.
. Select the allowed *Type* for the property.
+
TIP: If you select `Array`, go to the Actions column and click *+* to add sub-properties to the property.

. Enter a *Description*.
. If you want the property to be mandatory, activate the *Required* box.
. Click *Save*.

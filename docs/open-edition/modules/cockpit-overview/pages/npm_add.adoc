= Add npm modules

There are two ways to add new npm modules to your instance. You can either search and insert existing modules or add a new one.

//The installation process is also described here: xref:installation-guide:npm-module.adoc[Install npm modules]
//Todo Fabian: These two chapters have to be synchronized so that all information on how to get npm modules are in one place.

== Search for npm modules

In _NPM Modules_, you can search for npm modules that are used within the DXP - Open Edition.

Click on a module to open it. In *General* you see the following module details:

Name:: Name of the module.
Description:: What the module is about.
Version:: The version number of the module.
Path:: Where in the DXP - Open Edition the module is stored.
Dates:: When the module was created and last changed.

== Check for usage status

You can check which project within the DXP - Open Edition uses which module.

Click *Where-Used* to display the projects where the npm module is used.

== Edit a npm module

If you did not create a module, you can only edit the description of an existing module. If you created the module, you can change all settings.

* In *General*, click *Edit*.

The fields you can edit appear in white. The fields you cannot edit stay gray.

== Add a new npm module

You can add new npm modules from the web or from the DXP - Open Edition server.

. Click *Add* in the top right corner.

.. Enter a name in the search field to browse for modules on the web and follow the instructions.
.. Click *Local* to search for npm modules already existing on the server.
//Todo Neptune: I am not sure the test environment works correct here. If you click "Local", you are redirected to the Neptune website. If you click just below "Local" you can add a new module, although it says before that you can search for npm modules on the server when clicking here. I also tried the development environment but there you cannot click the "Add" button at all.

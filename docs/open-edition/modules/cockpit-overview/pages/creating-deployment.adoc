= Create a deployment package

In this topic, you learn how you create deployment packages, how you deploy them from one system to another.

You have three options to create and to deploy a deployment package:

* Create a deployment package and transfer it to systems in a defined order with one transfer (route).
* Create a deployment package and transfer it to one system or to different systems simultaneously.
* Create a deployment package only for export.

== Prerequisites
* Before you start a deployment process, make sure that the system you want to send the deployment packages to is available.
How to set up a remote system, see Remote System Setup.
//Todo Gernot link page Remote System
//todo Gernot: The system you want to send the deployment packages to is available (to you). Check the availability in xref:Remote systems.
* Optional: A deployment authentication is set in *Settings* > *Custom settings*.
//Provide a link to the topic.
//todo Gernot: can we have it in active? You have set...

== Procedure
. In the Cockpit, go to *Deployment*, and click *Deployment Create*.
//Open Neptune DXP - Open Edition cockpit > In the Cockpit, navigate (clicking) > go (no clicking)

//todo gernot: icons on the left need to be circles (or uncovered), text needs to be light grey, buttons need to be covered or removed. Also align text boxes.
+
*Result*: The deployment create window opens.
//todo gernot: The Deployment Create window opens.?
. Click *System* or *Routes*.
. Depending on the option you selected, check on the list one or more systems or routes, and click *Start*.
//todo Gernot:..., select one or more systems or routes from the list, and...
+
TIP: If you want to create a deployment package for export only, do not select a system or route, just click *Start*.
+
*Result*: The Deployment Create dialog opens.

//todo Gernot: same story, I'd cover the details. we cannot be sure the information is shown to the average user. Icons on bar are nicely done though. :)
. Click *Packages* to select already existing development packages.
+
TIP: The number next to *Packages* indicates the number of available packages.
+
. Check the package or packages you want to deploy.
//todo gernot: select instead of check.

. Click the arrow next to the service group to select a service you want to deploy artifacts from.
In the example, *Launchpad* from the *Administration* service group is selected.
//todo introduce service group?
//todo gernot: move "in the example..." to step result?
+
TIP: The number next to the service indicates the number of available artifacts.
+
*Result* _Deployment create_ shows a list of all artifacts of the selected service.
+

//todo gernot: cover entries in name and version in light grey. Also cover create. Why is include relations highlighted here?
. Check the artifacts you want to add.
//todo gernot: select instead of check

. Check *Include relations* to add all the links/relations to selected artifacts.
+
For example, if you select *Launchpad*, and you check *Include relations*, all the artifacts connected to *Launchpad* like *Tile*, *Tile group*, *API*, etc., will be deployed as well.
//todo gernot: Tip? or Example?
. Click *Create*.
+
*Result*: The Deploy window opens.

//todo gernot: not our light grey, highlight has shadow, aaaand cover other details.
. Verify the packages you want to deploy by checking or unchecking artifacts.
//todo gernot: selecting or deselecting
. Click *Create*.
//Todo Hendrik: In this view, there is a transfer button available as well. Clicking it produces an error message. Button obsolete?

== Results
* If you selected a route or system before, _Deployment Create_ creates a package that must be approved before transfer according to the deployment authentication selected in settings > customization component.
//todo gernot: customization component? Also: ...according to the deployment authentication you selected in...?
* If you did not select a route or system before, _Deployment Create_ creates a package for export.

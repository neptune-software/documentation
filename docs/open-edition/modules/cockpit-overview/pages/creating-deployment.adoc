= Create a deployment package

In this topic, you learn how you create deployment packages, how you deploy them from one system to another.

You have three options to create and to deploy a deployment package:

* Create a deployment package and transfer it to systems in a defined order with one transfer (route).
* Create a deployment package and transfer it to one system or to different systems simultaneously.
* Create a deployment package only for export.

== Prerequisites
* Before you start a deployment process, make sure that the system you want to send the deployment packages to is available.
How to set up a remote system, see xref:setup-remote-system.adoc[Setting up a remote system].
* Optional: You have set a deployment authentication in xref:settings-custom.adoc[Custom Settings].

. Click *Packages* to select already existing development packages.
+
TIP: The number next to *Packages* indicates the number of available packages.
+
. Select the package or packages you want to deploy.

. Click the arrow next to the service group to select a service you want to deploy artifacts from.
In the example, *Launchpad* from the *Administration* service group is selected.
+
TIP: The number next to the service indicates the number of available artifacts.
+
*Result* _Deployment create_ shows a list of all artifacts of the selected service.

. Select the artifacts you want to add.

. Check *Include relations* to add all the links/relations to selected artifacts.
For example, if you select *Launchpad*, and you check *Include relations*, all the artifacts connected to *Launchpad* like *Tile*, *Tile group*, *API*, etc., will be deployed as well.
. Click *Create*.
+
*Result*: The Deploy window opens.

. Verify the packages you want to deploy by selecting or deselecting artifacts.
. Click *Create*.
//Todo Hendrik: In this view, there is a transfer button available as well. Clicking it produces an error message. Button obsolete?

== Results
* If you selected a route or system before, _Deployment Create_ creates a package that must be approved before transfer according to the deployment authentication you selected in xref:settings-custom.adoc[Custom Settings].
* If you did not select a route or system before, _Deployment Create_ creates a package for export.

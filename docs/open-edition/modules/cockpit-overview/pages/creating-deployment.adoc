= Create a deployment package

In this topic, you learn how you create deployment packages, how you deploy them from one system to another.

You have two options to create and to deploy a deployment package:

* Create a deployment package and transferring it by selecting a route.
+
When using routes, you can transfer your package to any targeted system with one transfer process.
* Create a deployment package and transferring it by selecting a system.
//What's the difference between route and system when creating/transferring a deployment package?

== Prerequisites
* Before you start a deployment process, make sure that the remote server system you want to send the deployment packages to is available.
How to set up a remote system, see Remote System Setup.
//Todo Gernot link page Remote System
* Optional: A deployment authentication is set in *Settings* > *Custom settings*.
//Provide a link to the topic.

== Procedure

+
*Result*: The deployment create window opens

. Click *System* or *Routes*.
+
. Depending on the option you selected, check on the list one or more systems or routes, and click *Start*
+
TIP: Do not check any system or route if someone must first approve the deployment packages you create. In this case, click *start*.
//You do not have to select a route when pressing "Start"...
//"name" is activated when checking more than 1 item. Why?
+
*Result*: The Deployment Create dialog opens.

. Click *Packages* to select already existing packages.
+
TIP: The number next to *Packages* indicates the number of available packages.
//Use TIP
+
. Check the package or packages you want to deploy.
+
. Click the arrow next to the service group to select a service you want to deploy artifacts from.
In the example, *Launchpad* from the *Administration* service group is selected.
//todo introduce service group?
+
TIP: The number next to the service indicates the number of available artefacts.
+
*Result* _Deployment create_ shows a list of all artifacts of the selected service.
+

. Check the artifacts you want to add.
+

. To add all the links/relations to selected artifacts, check *Include relations*.
For example, if you select *Launchpad*, and you check *Include relations*, all the artifacts connected to *Launchpad* like *Tile*, *Tile group*, *API*, etc., will be deployed as well.

. Click *Create*.
+
*Result*: The Deploy window opens.

. Verify the packages you want to deploy by checking or unchecking artifacts.
. If you did not select a route or a target system before, click *Create*. There is no other option available.
If you selected a route or a target system before, you can choose between *Create* or *Transfer*.
* Click *Create* to create the deployment package that must be approved.
* Click *Transfer* to create the deployment package and deploy it on the selected target system.
//What about "Transfer" next to "Create"?
//Only shows up if you select a deployment package in system
+
*Result*: Depending on the steps you took before, _Deployment Create_ creates packages, that must be approved or _Deployment Create_ creates packages and transfers them to the selected remote system (for approval?).
//This will create your deployment package. Deployment Package will ask approval or transfer according to the deployment authentication selected in settings -> customization component.
//todo check again what's happening

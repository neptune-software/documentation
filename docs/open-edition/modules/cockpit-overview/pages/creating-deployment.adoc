= Create a deployment package

//Insert an introductory sentence in task topics: "In this topic, you learn how to create a deployment package."

You have two options:

* Create a deployment package and transferring it by selecting a route.
+
When using routes, you can transfer your package to any targeted system with one transfer process.
* Create a deployment package and transferring it by selecting a system.
//what's the difference between route and system when creating a deployment package?

== Prerequisites
* Before you start a deployment process, make sure that you set up a remote system you want to send the deployment packages to.
//Did you have to setup the remote system? Couldn't it be anyone else?
How to set up a remote system, see Remote System Setup.
//Todo Gernot link page Remote System
* You have selected a deployment authentication in *Settings* > *Customization component*.
//Provide a link to the topic.

The _App Designer_ is the central starting point for application development.
This is where you design the interface of your application, implement functionalities, and integrate data from resources.

The _App Designer_ is the starting point for the following actions:

* Building mobile and desktop applications
* Creating new HTML5 UIs
* Updating the existing UI

The _App Designer_ is a low code development environment suitable for most requirements and levels of complexity.
//todo Neptune: Input needed - does it mean: _App Designer_ is a low code building environment that meets the requirements for programming apps of almost any level of complexity?
//Neptune@Parson: Yes that sounds great.

In the _App Designer_, you drag and drop components to build an application.
You can use the following component types:

* Resource components, for example, to use Javascript and RestAPIs
* Highchart components to create graphs and plots
* Bootstrap components to design and structure your application and give them a non SAP look and feel
* OpenUI5 components to design and structure your application

Create applications in a no-code adaptive framework with _Adaptive Designer_.

Provide your adaptive applications in multiple machine-translated languages using the Google Translate API.

== Adaptive framework
The adaptive framework supports no-code development of adaptive applications in _Adaptive Designer_ using adaptive templates and predefined data sources.

//TODO Leonie: nice to have overview graphic containing data sources, connector, adaptive designer, launchpad, store, adaptive templates

Predefined data sources:: A table or a server script is a predefined data source that provides the data for the adaptive applications in the adaptive framework. You can publish tables and server scripts in the _Connector_ service to use them in _Adaptive Designer_. Additionally, you can import tables from Excel.

Adaptive templates:: Adaptive templates provide the configuration metadata for your adaptive applications. You can download adaptive templates in the application building block *Adaptive Framework* from the _Store_.

Design adaptive applications:: You create, adapt, and translate your adaptive applications in _Adaptive Designer_ representing the central service in your adaptive framework.

Run adaptive applications:: In combination, an adaptive template and a predefined data source enable the creation and output of adaptive applications. With the _Launchpad_ service, the adaptive applications can be integrated in a launchpad and run alongside any other applications.

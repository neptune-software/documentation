Create adaptive applications.

With the _Adaptive Designer_, functional developers and business users, who have little technical experience, can create responsive, customizable, and functional applications without writing a single line of code.

_Adaptive Designer_ comes with templates that represent the foundation and structure for different types of applications. Currently, the following templates are available:

* Business Intelligence
//Todo Neptune: Is this Analytic now?
* List
* Detail
//Todo Neptune: Is this Edit now?
* Tiles
//Leonie: reconsider display of adaptive templates in general and start with app vs tile and the subordinate templates. Focus on main function of the repsective template.
//Leonie: If terminology is outdated, the following graphic has to be removed.

By combining an adaptive framework with a database or other data source, _Adaptive Designer_ enables drag and drop functionality that allows business users to create applications that are tailored to their requirements.

Because an adaptive application is based on a template, any changes you make to the template will reflect across all the applications that use it.
This way, you can adjust entire suits of applications from one source.

== Architecture
_Adaptive Designer_ is part of an adaptive framework.
A database or a server script provide the data for the applications.
Templates provide the configuration metadata.

Templates and database/server script connection combined enable the output of adaptive applications that can run on the __Launchpad__ alongside any other application.

== Download the templates
//Leonie: no need for a separate section; avoid task-like representation; mention this in the template concept section; pick up application building block terminology here?

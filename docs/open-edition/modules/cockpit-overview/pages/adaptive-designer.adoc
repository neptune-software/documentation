Create adaptive applications.
//TODO Leonie: Think of replacing the service description completely in this case.
//TODO Leonie: Bring in the aspect of translation.
_Adaptive Designer_ is your starting point to create responsive, customizable, and functional applications without writing a single line of code.

== Adaptive framework
The adaptive framework supports no-code development of applications in _Adaptive Designer_ using adaptive templates and predefined data sources.
The adaptive framework consists of the following components:

* Predefined data sources
* _Adaptive Designer_
* Adaptive templates
* Launchpad

//TODO Leonie: Polish following paragraph; fix Launchpad terminology; Mention Store and Connector service
A database or a server script provide the data for the applications.
Templates provide the configuration metadata.
Templates and database/server script connection combined enable the output of adaptive applications that can run on the __Launchpad__ alongside any other application.

//TODO Leonie: Think of outsourcing templates completely and pick up main concept in framework.
== Adaptive templates

_Adaptive Designer_ comes with templates that represent the foundation and structure for different types of applications. Currently, the following templates are available:

* Business Intelligence
//Todo Leonie: Is this Analytic now? -> Yes
* List
* Detail
//Todo Leonie: Is this Edit now? -> Yes
* Tiles
//TODO Leonie: reconsider display of adaptive templates in general and start with app vs tile and the subordinate templates. Focus on main function of the respective template.

//TODO Leonie: Use following paragraph as input for intro.
By combining an adaptive framework with a database or other data source, _Adaptive Designer_ enables drag and drop functionality that allows business users to create applications that are tailored to their requirements.
Because an adaptive application is based on a template, any changes you make to the template will reflect across all the applications that use it.
This way, you can adjust entire suits of applications from one source.

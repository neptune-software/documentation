With the _Adaptive Designer_, functional developers and business users, who have little technical experience, can create responsive, customizable, and functional applications without writing a single line of code.

_Adaptive Designer_ comes with templates that represent the foundation and structure for different types of applications. There are currently the following templates available:

* Business Intelligence
* List
* Detail
* Tiles

By combining an adaptive framework with a database or other data source, _Adaptive Designer_ enables drag and drop functionality that allows business users to create applications that are tailored to their requirements.

Because an adaptive application is based on a template, any changes you make to the template will reflect across all the applications that use it.
This way, you can adjust entire suits of applications from one source.

Templates are essentially applications and can be designed, built, and adjusted by a low-code or pro-code developer within the _Application Designer_.
//@Neptune: Update needed: Connectors are now used to publish the data sources for the applications.

== Architecture
_Adaptive Designer_ is part of an adaptive framework.
A database or a server script provide the data for the applications.
Templates provide the configuration metadata.

Templates and database/server script connection combined enable the output of adaptive applications that can run on the __Launchpad__ alongside any other application.

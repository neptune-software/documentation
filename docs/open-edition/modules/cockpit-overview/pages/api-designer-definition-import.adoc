= Import a definition into an API

In this topic, you learn how to add a definition based on a sample response of your API.
In many cases, importing a definition is faster than adding one manually.
After importing a definition you can still make changes.

We use the _API Client_ to create a response in JSON format.
You can instead use a JSON or YAML response that you created another way, that is, outside Neptune DXP.

== Prerequisites

* You have configured an API of any type.
* You have added an operation to the API.

== Procedure

. In the Cockpit, go to *Connectivity* and click _API Client_.
. In the API table, go to your API and click the operation you want to add a definition to.
+
*Result*: The test page for the selected operation opens.
You see the endpoint, and any parameters and headers that are defined for the operation.

. If you want to change the response, edit parameters, headers or the endpoint.
. Click *Send*.
+
*Result*: The *Response* tab opens.
You see the type, URL, response body, and headers.
. Copy the response body to the clipboard.
. On the shell bar, click the Neptune icon or use the search bar to navigate to the _API Designer_.
. In the API table, click the API.
+
*Result*: The API configuration dialog opens.
. Navigate to the *Definitions* tab and click *+* to add a definition.
. Enter a *Name* and *Description*.
. Navigate to the *Properties* tab.
. On the toolbar, click *JSON Import*.
+
*Result*: The *Import API* dialog opens.
. Paste the response from the clipboard and click *Import*.
+
*Result*: The _API Designer_ adds properties based on the response.
You can still add, edit, or delete properties.
. Click *Save*.

== Results

* You have imported a definition with properties from a sample response.

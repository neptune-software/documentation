= Import a definition into an API

In this topic, you learn how to add a definition based on a sample response of your API.
In many cases, importing a definition is faster than adding one manually.
After importing a definition you can still make changes.

We use the _API Client_ to create a response in JSON format.
You can use a JSON or YAML response that you created another way instead, that is, outside Neptune DXP.

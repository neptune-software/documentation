= Create general structure

In this step, you create a general structure for your application and add  a *Shell*, *App*, and other components.
The *Shell* provides functionality and allows for visual adaptation of your application.
The *App* provides a more detailed graphical user interface for your application.

*Shell* and *App* build the base of Open UI5 any application you create with the DXP - Open Edition.
//@Neptune: assumption, please check.
//Neptune@Parson: *of any UI5 application you create...

[NOTE]
====
The following steps use the component tree from the *Reusable component* panel to navigate to components.
Instead of using the component tree you can also search for the component in the search field above the *Reusable component* panel.

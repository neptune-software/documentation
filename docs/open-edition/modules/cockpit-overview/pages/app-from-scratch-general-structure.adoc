= Create general structure

In this step, you create a general structure for your application and add  a *Shell*, *App*, and other components.
The *Shell* provides functionality and allows for visual adaptation of your application.
The *App* provides a more detailed graphical user interface.

*Shell* and *App* build the base of any Open UI5 application you create with the DXP - Open Edition.


== Prerequisites

* You have done the xref:app-from-scratch-first-configuration.adoc[first configuration of your application].

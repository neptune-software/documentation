= Create general structure

In this step, you create a general structure for your application and add  a *Shell*, *App*, and other components.
The *Shell* provides functionality and allows for visual adaptation of your application.
The *App* provides a more detailed graphical user interface.

*Shell* and *App* build the base of any Open UI5 application you create with the DXP - Open Edition.

[NOTE]
====
The following steps use the component tree from the component library to navigate to components.
Instead of using the component tree you can also search for the component in the search field above the component library.

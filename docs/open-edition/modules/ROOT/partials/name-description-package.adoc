quick guide include:

include everything:
include::ROOT:partial$name-description-package.adoc[]

include only name:
include::ROOT:partial$name-description-package.adoc[tag=name]

include everything but name:
include::ROOT:partial$name-description-package.adoc[tags=*;!name]
IMPORTANT: tags (plural) not tag (singular). You can always use plural form, even for one argument. For more than one argument you MUST use plural form.

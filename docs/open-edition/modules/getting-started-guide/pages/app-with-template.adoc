= Create an application with templates

//Helle: base https://community.neptune-software.com/documentation/develop-your-planet9-second-app

In this topic you learn how to start creating an application using the _App Designer_ and get familiar with the *SplitApp* template that comes with the Neptune DXP - Open Edition.

You can follow step-by-step to use a pre-made API or adjust the steps to use an API that you made yourself.


TIP: Save your new application any time in the process and return to it later.
To continue building your application, open it in the __App Designer__ and click *Toggle to edit mode* on the top menu.

== Prerequisites

* You have installed your Neptune DXP - Open Edition.
* You have the developer role assigned.

== Procedure

=== Configure an application with a *SplitApp* template

The *SplitApp* template is the base for an app with a general Page (Detail Page) and a Master Page.
The Detail Page shows information in its entirety.
The Master Page is a side menu that shows only key information and helps navigate through entries of a data table.
//Helle@Neptune: assumption, please check.

. Open the cockpit of your Neptune DXP - Open Edition and click _App Designer_.
+

. In the Cockpit, open the *Application* drop-down menu and click *Create*.
. In the *New App* dialog, enter a *Name* of you choice.
. Under *Type*, select *Application*.
. From the *Templates* panel, select the *SplitApp* template and click *Save*.
+

+
*Result*: You see the main designer environment, now with an  HTML document consisting of a *Shell*, an *App* and two *Page* components with additional subcomponents.
Here, you perform front-end coding. The Master and Detail pages define the two sides of the *SplitApp*.
. On the side menu, click the *Settings* icon.
+

+
*Result*: The *Application Settings* window opens.
+
. In *General*, enter a *Description* for your application and a *Title*.
//Helle@Neptune: Where does this appear? Is it visible to the user of the application or the devs only?
. Under *OpenUI5*, select an Open UI5 *Version*, *Theme*, and *Language* for your application.

+
TIP: The preselected Belize theme gives you the most popular look and feel.
. On the top menu, click *Save*.
+

*Result*: You have configured your application.

TIP: You will start using the _App Designer_ to create an application.

=== Add resources

Now you add data resources to you application. The data is later displayed on the Master Page.

[NOTE]
====
The following steps use the component tree from the *Reusable component* panel to navigate to components. Instead of using the component tree you can also search for the component in the search field above the *Reusable component* panel.

====

. On the *Reusable component* panel, open *Resources* and drag and drop the *RestAPI* component onto *Resources* in the *Application component* panel.
. On the *Reusable component* panel, drag and drop the *MultiModel* component onto *Resources* in the *Application component* panel.
. Click on the *RestAPI* component.
. On the *UI object* panel, click the *Rest API* field to open the *Rest API* library.
. Search either your API or *SAP Example API (Training)*.
. Click on the operation */CustomerList* with the *GET* *Method*.
+
image::appdesigner-restapi-library-popup-sapexample.png[width=800]
+
. On the *Component properties* panel, open the *API* tab > *Response* > *200*.
. Click the field that matches the operation of your API and select *oMultiModel* from the list.
. On the *Model* tab, click the *setInitLoad* field and select *online* from the list.
. On the *Application component* panel, click *oMultiModel*.
. On the *UI object* panel, click the *Model Source* field and, from the *Binding* pop-up window, select the *Property* from your API.
In our example, that is "/getCustomerListResponse".

*Result*: You have added an API to the application and bound the data to the *MultiModel* component.

=== Create a list on the *Master Page*

In this step, you bind data from the resources to a list from the Master Page.

. On the *Application component* panel, open *oPageMaster* and click the *oList* component.
. On the *UI object* panel, click the icon in the *Model Path* field.
. On the *Binding* pop-up window, open *oMultiModel* > *getCustomerListResponse* > *result* and select *IT_CUSTOMERS*.
. On the *Application component* panel, open *oList* and click the *oObjectListItem*.
. On the *Component properties* panel, open *Properties*, go to *title* and click the *connected* icon.

+
//Helle@parson: Hovering over the icon shows the text "connected" even for empty fields. More fitting would be "Bind". This is also reflected in the pop-up window when clicking the icon. Use Bind or connected?
. On the *Binding* pop-up window, open *IT_CUSTOMERS* and click the *NAME1* property.
. On the *Application component* panel, open *oObjectListItem* and click on the *oObjectAttribute* component.
. On the *Component properties* panel, open *Properties*.
. Go to *text* and click the *connected* icon.
. On the *Binding* pop-up window, open *IT_CUSTOMERS* and select the *ORTO1* property.
. Go to *title* and enter "City".
. On the *Applications component* panel, click the *oObjectStatus* component.
. On the *Component properties* panel, open *Properties*, go to *text* and click the *connected* icon.
. On the *Binding* pop-up window, select the *LAND1* property.
. Go to *title* and enter "Country".
. On the top menu, click *Save* and *Activate*.

* You have created an application with the *SplitApp* template.
* You have integrated data from an API.
* You have bound specific properties from the API to the Master Page of your application.

= Runtime environment

Neptune DX Platform is a node.js runtime environment. node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment.

With npm, you can extend the functionality of the DXP - Open Edition with the choice of over a million different packages. These packages range from managing connections over legacy databases to handling authentication tokens.

== Databases
By default, the DXP - Open Edition comes with an embedded SQlite database, which can be used for database tables.
The DXP - Open Edition also uses this database for its own configuration tables.

Alternatively, you can use the following databases:

* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* SAP HANA databases

== TypeORM
All supported databases can use TypeORM. ORM (object-relational mapping) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm.

You can use TypeORM statements instead of traditional SQL statements to interact with the database layer.

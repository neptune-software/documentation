== Resources
=== oDATA
The _OData source_ component is used to consume data from an Open Data Protocol service.

The _App Designer_ consumes oDATA.


=== Store
The _API Designer_ and _App Designer_ use the _Store_ to publish and download APIs and applications.

=== Media Library
The _Media Library_ is where you store all media files you want to use in an application. Media files stored in the _Media Library_ can be used when creating an application with the _App Designer_.


=== API Designer
With the _API Designer_ you create and configure API definitions.
You can also import _External APIs_.

You can use the _Table Definition_ to create APIs from a local table.

The _App Designer_ can integrate APIs from the _API Designer_ with no-code data binding.

=== Table Definition
Use _Table Definition_ to create APIs from a local table.

You can also use _Table Definition_ to create server-side scripts with the _Script Editor_.

== Tools
=== App Designer
With _App Designer_, you create HTML5-based applications.

The _App Designer_ consumes _oDATA_ and server scripts from the _Script Engine_.

The _App Designer_ uses the following resources:

* _Store_, to publish or download applications
* _Media Library_, for media files that can be used in applications
* _API Designer_, to integrate APIs with no-code binding

=== Server Scripts (Script Editor)
With _Script Editor_, you create server-side scripts that run in their own separate process on the server.

_App Designer_ consumes server scripts.

=== Workflow Designer (Workflow Engine)
With _Workflow Engine_, you design, build, run, and manage workflows. Workflows define a sequential order of tasks that are performed by server scripts or users.

_Workflow Engine_ uses server scripts from the _Script Editor_.
You can trigger workflows in applications.

[#_operationmanagementsecurity]
== Operation, management, and security
=== Theme Designer
With _Theme Designer_, you customize the look and feel of your apps.

_Theme Designer_ is used in _App Designer_ and _Launchpad_.

=== Application Management
You create new applications with _App Designer_ and trigger workflows in the applications from _Workflow Engine_.

The _Application Management_ view shows all applications in the system.

You can display apps in _Tiles_, _Tile Groups_, on the _Launchpad_, and in _Mobile Client_.

=== Tile
A _Tile_ is a container that represents an application. All applications have at least one corresponding _Tile_.

_Tiles_ are displayed in _Tile Groups_ and on the _Launchpad_.

=== Tile Group
_Tile Groups_ organize _Tiles_ based on user roles. You can assign user roles and _Tiles_ to a _Tile Group_.

=== Launchpad
_Launchpad_ is the entry point to applications and displays a home page with _Tiles_ and _Tile Groups_.

Each _Tile_ represents an application that the user can launch.

Users access _Launchpad_ from a desktop computer or a _Mobile Client_. _Launchpad_ is role-based and display tiles according to the role of the user.

=== Users
With the _User_ management system, you manage internal (_own users_) and _external_ users and assign roles and groups to them.

You store users on cloud-based *LDAP* and *SAML2* servers.

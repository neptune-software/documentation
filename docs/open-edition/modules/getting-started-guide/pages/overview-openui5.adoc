= Open UI5 framework
//Fabian@Helle: Das hier kommt offenbar aus der alten Doku, ich habe keine Ahnung, ob und wozu man das braucht. Vielleicht sollte man es an eine andere Stelle in der Doku verschieben oder ganz löschen (?).

//Helle@Fabian: Die Beispiele können wir für ein Cookbook verwenden. Die konzeptuellen Infos wie Aggregations und Bindings vielleicht vorziehen. Würde ich dem App Designer zuordnen. Können wir besprechen und ne Strategie überlegen.


Open UI5 is the base for all UI artifacts and their functionalities.

.Example: `Date picker`
We want users to open a calendar and select a date.

The name of the artifact is `sap.m.DatePicker`.
In the _App Designer_, the default name of the artifact is `oDatePicker`.

On the page, the `oDatePicker` artifact is an input field that opens a calendar and allows the user to select a date.

Building on this example, you can add a shell, app and page as parent artifacts to the `DatePicker`.
Now you can see the date picker inside the app.

This shell–app–page structure is the most common foundation for apps within the _App Designer_ and represents an aggregation.

== Aggregations
An aggregation is a parent-child relationship between two UI elements.

The shell-app–page structure is an aggregation where you can put as many child artifacts within the page as you want.

IMPORTANT: There are aggregations that do not work and cause errors. *Example*: Inserting a Slider component directly in a list cause an error stating that a Slider is not a valid aggregation for a list. However, a list can contain a number of children, such as a `StandardListItem`. This will not cause problems.

.Example: `IconTabBar`
There is an `IconTabBar` artifact with three `IconTabFilters`, of which one contains a text component.

In this example, there is a `MenuButton` parent which contains a `Menu` artifact as child.
Within that child, there are five `MenuItem` children artifacts, with two of them as sub-children to a parent's `MenuItem`.

This produces the `Menu` button that reflects the same structure.

.Example: `Table`
The table is built using `sap.m.table` as parent, with `sap.m.Column` artifacts as children alongside a `ColumnListItem`. It contains five `Text` artifacts.

You can also generate these structures automatically using wizards, such as with this table.

== Events
Many of the artifacts within the UI5 library contain events.

.Example: `Button`
A `Button` artifact has a `Press` event.
Within the event, you can write any JavaScript functionality you want.
The event runs every time the button is pressed.
In this example, the button sends the app to the `nextPage`, sets a `Lists` visibility property to `True` and shows a message on the screen.

.Example: `SearchField`
The `SearchField` component has a `LiveChange` event.
The `LiveChange` event is triggered everytime a change is made in the field, such as a key being pressed.
In this event, we have implemented a search on a list, so each key press updates the list with the search results based on what is typed.

You can always click on the properties of the components to view information about them.
Here you can see a description of each event and when it is triggered.

== Bindings
Binding is the ability to link data to specific parts of the UI components.

.Example
There is a list with an `ObjectListItem` child artifact.
You can send an array of objects to the underlying data model of the list.

Within the `ObjectListItem` child component, you can bind properties.
Here we have bound the `Intro` and `Title` properties to the `Name` and `CustomerNumber` keys of our data set.

This results in a list that automatically generates the same number of rows as there are objects in the array, with each row showing the values based on the bounded keys.

After these bindings are set up, your components will always reflect the data automatically.
That means, only two objects are returned instead.
You can see that the list reflects only these two rows.

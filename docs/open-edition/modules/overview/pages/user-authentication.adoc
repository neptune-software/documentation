= User authentication

By default, a user will have its credentials stored in Neptune DXP - Open Edition itself (using bcrypt). There are a number of password policies that can be configured, such as minimum password length or time-based expiration. This is convenient if you don't have a lot of users.

However, for large organisations, Neptune DXP - Open Edition supports multiples Users Security and Authentication Processes, including certification-based authentication like X.509 certification, cloud-based authentication like Azure AD and SAML based authorisation and authorisation.
